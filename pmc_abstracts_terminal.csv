The authors proceeded to a 7 month long prevalence survey on epilepsy in the 
schools of the regions of Dakar and Thies in Senegal, West africa. It consisted 
to a cross sectional descriptive study targeting the children between 3 and 10 
years old. The W.H.O. questionnaire on epilepsy was used for data collection. 
Among the 2803 children of the population study, 58 were detected suffering from 
epilepsy, realizing a prevalence rate of 21%. The males were more represented 
(62% of the epilepsies). All the epileptic children presented generalized 
seizures represented either by ""Grand Mal"" generalized tonic-clonic form (84.4% 
of the epilepsies), or by ""Petit Mal"" absences (15.6% of the epilepsies). The 
etiological forms were dominated by idiopathic epilepsies. Secondary generalized 
cases represented 31% of the epilepsy and were essentially detected in rural 
areas. They were usually related to obstetrical traumas (61.1% of the secondary 
generalized epilepsies) or to child encephalopathy with seizure attacks (38.9% 
of the secondary generalized epilepsies). It appears also from this study that 
epilepsy remains a dramatic public health reality and is more frequent among low 
economy income people who have less access to the health care system.

An acetyltransferase gene (Tri3) was isolated from Fusarium sporotrichioides by 
complementation of a previously identified Tri3- mutant and shown to be closely 
linked to three other trichothecene biosynthetic pathway genes. Comparison of 
the Tri3 sequence with its cDNA revealed the presence of four introns. The Tri3 
cDNA contains a 1,539-bp open reading frame that encodes a protein with a 
molecular mass of 57,418 Da. Regulation of Tri3 transcription in liquid cultures 
appeared identical to that of other trichothecene pathway genes. Disruption of 
the Tri3 gene resulted in the accumulation of deacetylated calonectrins rather 
than T-2 toxin. The results of whole-cell feeding experiments with Tri3- strains 
suggested that 15-O-acetylation is blocked. Cell-free feeding experiments 
confirmed that Tri3- strains are able to acetylate a trichothecene C-3 hydroxyl 
group but are unable to acetylate a trichothecene C-15 hydroxyl group. Our 
results show that Tri3 encodes an acetyltransferase that converts 
15-decalonectrin to calonectrin.

Prolonged Q-T interval syndrome presenting as idiopathic epilepsy.

Pignata C, Farina V, Andria G, Del Giudice E, Striano S, Adinolfi L.

We report the case of a 4 1/2-year-old girl admitted to our Hospital because of 
repeated tonic convulsions. These attacks were triggered by noxious stimuli as 
well as by emotional stress. Since patient's history was not typical of 
idiopathic epilepsy, and several electroencephalograms failed to reveal any 
abnormality, a cardiac basis for the clinical picture was suspected. Resting 
electrocardiograms and 48-hour ECG recording showed a prolonged Q-T interval, 
usually responsible for severe cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular 
fibrillation or ""torsades de pointe""). In our patient the neurologic paroxysmal 
symptomatology, wrongly considered as idiopathic epilepsy, should be interpreted 
being due to the underlying cardiac abnormality.

The gene for human cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIIa liver isoform (COX7AL) was 
isolated and its sequence determined and analyzed. The three introns of the gene 
are considerably larger than those of the heart isoform of subunit VIIa 
(COX7AH), but the position of the introns relative to the cDNA sequences is 
homologous between the two genes. Comparison with other isolated COX7AL genes 
suggests that the promoter region binding motifs for transcription factors have 
evolved along with the coding region. In fibroblasts cultured originally from a 
Leigh's disease patient, a shortened COX7AL cDNA was identified by RT-PCR, 
consisting of exon I joined to exon IV, omitting exons II and III. No mutation 
could be identified in COX7AL of the patient, suggesting that the shortened cDNA 
is due to an alteration of the genome during cell culture. A surprising 
transcription of COX7AH was observed in cultured fibroblasts, suggesting a 
potential utility of these cells for study of its gene expression.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether color flow pulsed Doppler analysis of corpus 
luteum blood flow in normal cycles differs from cycles with a luteal phase 
defect.
DESIGN: A prospective study of natural ovarian cycles.
SETTING: The University of Vermont Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility 
Service.
PATIENTS: Ten women with regular menstrual cycles and at risk for luteal phase 
defect (LPD) four with unexplained infertility, two with recurrent abortion, and 
four with age > 35 years.
INTERVENTIONS: All women were examined by transvaginal color flow pulsed Doppler 
during the early follicular, late follicular, early luteal, midluteal, and late 
luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Venous blood for P concentration was drawn 
on each day of Doppler exam. Urine testing for LH surge and endometrial biopsy 
during the late luteal phase were performed on each patient.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lowest resistance index associated with the highest 
amplitude signal from intraovarian vessels of each ovary, dated endometrial 
biopsies, serum P.
RESULTS: Mean resistance indexes in LPD patients (n = 3) were significantly 
higher compared with normal women (n = 6) throughout the follicular and luteal 
phases. One patient remained anovulatory and was excluded from statistical 
analysis. Although systolic and diastolic velocities generally were observed to 
be lower in LPD patients compared with normal women, these differences were not 
statistically significant. High correlations were observed between P and 
resistance index within each luteal time point, achieving its highest value 
during the midluteal phase.
CONCLUSIONS: This initial study provides evidence that color flow pulsed Doppler 
analysis of blood flow impedance to the corpus luteum may aid in assessing 
luteal phase adequacy.

Use of automatic counting of basophil leukocytes: correlation of basophil 
degranulation with histamine release.

Van Toorenenbergen AW, Kramps JA, Van der Burgh JF, Dijkman JH.

The sensitivity of leukocytes from allergic donors towards specific allergen was 
studied using the basophil degranulation test. In this test, basophil leukocytes 
were counted with the Technicon Hemalog D. A good correlation was found between 
the results of the basophil degranulation test and the results of the histamine 
release test on leukocytes of the same patient. The basophil degranulation test, 
using the Hemalog D, was found to be a simple method for in vitro assessment of 
the sensitivity of allergic patients to specific allergen.

[Use of Electronic Spin Resonance in the study of dental enamel caries. 
Preliminary results].

degli Studi, L'Aquila.

BACKGROUND: By means of the Electron Spin Resonance technique (EPR) it is 
possible to detect carbonate-related paramagnetic centers in human tooth enamel. 
Several arguments indicate that the radicals formed after X-ray irradiation 
(CO2- and CO3(3-)) are ascribed to carbonate which is the most important 
constituent of hydroxyapatite. There is experimental evidence that the 
distribution of the orientation of these centers is related to microcrystal 
alignment in dental enamel, which might be responsible for caries 
susceptibility. The results reported in the literature, however, should be 
interpreted very carefully.
METHODS: In our own preliminary research we studied twenty-seven samples of 
dental enamel taken from the buccal face of upper molars. Fifteen were carious 
and the other ones were sound. We used the R-parameter and the S-parameter to 
convert our experimental results into numerical values. The R-parameters, as 
introduced by Cevc et al. (1976-1980) is the ratio of the amplitude for the high 
field and the low component of the EPR signal. The S-parameter is the ratio of 
the amplitude of the A2 component and the low one.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the R and S-value of 
carious and sound dental enamel samples. The degree of microcrystal alignment in 
enamel of clinically sound upper molar from their buccal site is very high. 
However, this result is not sufficient to evaluate the caries susceptibility or 
the caries resistance of tooth enamel.
CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we can conclude that it is not sufficient to ascribe the 
caries susceptibility to the R-value, because other factors (such as etiological 
factors and the structure of the teeth) should be considered.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the availability of 
paracetamol and its use for overdose and suicide.
DESIGN: Analysis of routinely collected information on time trends for 
paracetamol suicides, non-fatal overdoses, and sales.
SETTING: England and Wales and France.
RESULTS: There were strong correlations between trends in paracetamol sales in 
the UK and trends in non-fatal paracetamol overdose in Oxford between 1976 and 
1993 (Spearman's r = 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54, 0.96) and between 
paracetamol sales and non-fatal overdoses in France between 1974 and 1990 (r = 
0.99; 95% CI 0.97, 1.00). Sales figures were also correlated with paracetamol 
related suicides in both England and Wales, 1983-91 (r = 0.72; 95% CI 0.11, 
0.94) and France, 1974-90 (r = 0.79; 95% CI 0.50, 0.92). Similarly strong 
relationships were observed between trends in non-fatal overdoses and suicide by 
paracetamol poisoning in England and Wales (r = 0.85; 95% CI 0.61, 0.95) and 
France (r = 0.79; 95% CI 0.50, 0.92). It is estimated that approximately 32,000 
overdoses involving paracetamol occur annually in England and Wales. Fatality 
rates from paracetamol overdose were four times as high in England and Wales 
(0.4%, 95% CI 0.38, 0.46) as in France (0.1%, 95% CI 0.06, 0.17).
CONCLUSION: Trends towards greater availability of paracetamol are paralleled by 
increases in its use for both non-fatal overdose and suicide. Paracetamol 
related morbidity and mortality seem to be less frequent in France where the 
quantity of paracetamol in a single purchase is limited. Although not 
conclusive, these data add to a body of evidence which suggests that 
restrictions in the quantity of paracetamol available as a single purchase in 
the UK may reduce suicide and liver failure related to paracetamol.

The use of a hydroxylapatite-filter steroid receptor assay method in the study 
of the modulation of androgen receptor interaction.

Liao S, Witte D, Schilling K, Chang C.

Receptors for androgen, estrogen, and glucocorticoid can be assayed by 
hydroxylapatite adsorption of the radioactive steroid-receptor complex and 
washing of the adducts on membrane filters mounted on a multiple filter holder. 
The method is economical, very rapid and sensitive. This new receptor assay 
method was used to study the modulation of androgen receptor of rat ventral 
prostate by metal ions, thiols, and ligand structure. The interaction of 
androgen with the naked receptor is inhibited by 10 microM ZnCl2, CdSO4, or 
CuSO4 but this inhibition is competed by androgen and is reversed by DTT. The 
androgen-receptor complex is less sensitive to divalent metal ions but Zn2+, at 
3 mM, appears to alter the conformation of the receptor and promote the release 
of androgen. Certain phenanthrene derivatives exhibited striking structural 
specificities in their ability to compete with radioactive androgen for binding 
to the prostate receptor. The results suggest that the receptor has binding 
preference toward individual ring structure in the steroid.

Large inferior right hepatic vein. Clinical implications.

Champetier J(1), Haouari H, Le Bas JF, Létoublon C, Alnaasan I, Farah I.

Author information:
(1)Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine of Grenoble, La Tronche, France.

The right middle and inferior hepatic vv. are very frequent, indeed constant, 
but usually of small caliber. The presence of an extra-wide right inferior 
hepatic v., usually solitary, produces a variation in the venous drainage of the 
right lobe of the liver. The right inferior hepatic vv. reaching or exceeding a 
caliber of 0.5 cm were investigated in 125 anatomic liver specimens: 70 
injection-corrosion specimens, 32 formolised livers and frontal or 
frontal-oblique sections of the trunk made in 23 cadavers. The incidence of such 
vv. was estimated at 9% in the injection-corrosion specimens, 13% in the 
sections and 16% in the formolised livers. The incidence of these vv. in the 
literature varies from 10% to 24% according to the method used to demonstrate 
them. Usually, there is a balance between the right superior and inferior 
hepatic vv. Rarely, the right inferior hepatic v. predominates compared with the 
right superior hepatic v. The position of an extra-wide right inferior hepatic 
v. is constant, close to the visceral aspect of the liver. Its appropriate 
territory is segment VI, but it may encroach somewhat on adjacent segments. 
Clinically, the existence of an extrawide right inferior hepatic v. as detected 
by MRI and, especially, located by intraoperative ultrasonography, allows 
performance of a subtotal hepatectomy leaving only segment VI. In certain 
pathologic conditions, thanks to the development of anastomoses between the 
hepatic vv., an extra-wide right inferior hepatic v. may contribute to a 
compensatory circulation towards the right atrium.

Association of monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity with alcoholism and alcoholic 
subtypes.

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychiatry, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City.

A familial/genetic study of platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity in 
alcoholics was carried out. MAO activities were determined using 
phenylethylamine (PEA) as substrate at Km concentration (1.2 microM) and at 
saturating concentration (12.0 microM). Complex segregation analysis of familial 
data indicated a single major gene mode of transmission of activity at both 
substrate concentrations. In addition, the present sample size (13 families, 108 
members) proved sufficient to allow correlation analysis of enzyme activity with 
affection status and clinical subtypes of affecteds. MAO activity was 
significantly correlated with alcoholism at both Km and saturating substrate 
concentrations and a significant correlation between low MAO activity and 
Cloninger Type II alcoholism was seen at Km substrate concentration. These 
results confirm a hierarchical cosegregation of platelet MAO activity and 
alcoholism suggesting that MAO activity warrants continued status as a marker in 
alcoholism.

Synaptic inputs to stellate cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus.

Ferragamo MJ(1), Golding NL, Oertel D.

(1)Department of Neurophysiology, University of Wisconsin Medical School, 
Madison, Wisconsin 53706-1532, USA.

Auditory information is carried from the cochlear nuclei to the inferior 
colliculi through six parallel ascending pathways, one of which is through 
stellate cells of the ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN) through the trapezoid body. 
To characterize and identify the synaptic influences on T stellate cells, 
intracellular recordings were made from anatomically identified stellate cells 
in parasagittal slices of murine cochlear nuclei. Shocks to the auditory nerve 
consistently evoked five types of synaptic responses in T stellate cells, which 
reflect sources intrinsic to the cochlear nuclear complex. 1) Monosynaptic 
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that were blocked by 
6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), an antagonist of 
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors, probably 
reflected activation by auditory nerve fibers. Electrophysiological estimates 
indicate that about five auditory nerve fibers converge on one T stellate cell. 
2) Disynaptic, glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) arise 
through inhibitory interneurons in the VCN or in the dorsal cochlear nucleus 
(DCN). 3) Slow depolarizations, the source of which has not been identified, 
that lasted between 0.2 and 1 s and were blocked by -2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric 
acid (APV), the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. 4) Rapid, late 
glutamatergic EPSPs are polysynaptic and may arise from other T stellate cells. 
5) Trains of late glycinergic IPSPs after single or repetitive shocks match the 
responses of D stellate cells, showing that D stellate cells are one source of 
glycinergic inhibition to T stellate cells. The source of late, polysynaptic 
EPSPs and IPSPs was assessed electrophysiologically and pharmacologically. Late 
synaptic responses in T stellate cells were enhanced by repetitive stimulation, 
indicating that the interneurons from which they arose should fire trains of 
action potentials in responses to trains of shocks. Late EPSPs and late IPSPs 
were blocked by APV and enhanced by the removal of Mg2+, indicating that the 
interneurons were driven at least in part through NMDA receptors. Bicuculline, a 
gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor antagonist, enhanced the late PSPs, 
indicating that GABAergic inhibition suppresses both the glycinergic 
interneurons responsible for the trains of IPSPs in T-stellate cells and the 
interneuron responsible for late EPSPs in T stellate cells. The glycinergic 
interneurons that mediate the series of IPSPs are intrinsic to the ventral 
cochlear nucleus because long series of IPSPs were recorded from T stellate 
cells in slices in which the DCN was removed. These experiments indicate that T 
stellate cells are a potential source of late EPSPs and that D stellate cells 
are a potential source for trains of late IPSPs.

The Short NART: cross-validation, relationship to IQ and some practical 
considerations.

Beardsall & Brayne (1990) have presented a method whereby the full-length 
National Adult Reading Test (NART) scores of subjects who are of below average 
reading ability can be predicted from performance on the first half of the test 
(termed the Short NART). The accuracy with which the Short NART predicted 
full-length NART scores was examined in a large cross-validation sample (N = 
674). A subgroup of this sample (N = 142) was administered the WAIS. The results 
indicated that the Short NART was only moderately successful in predicting 
full-length NART scores. However, comparison of the accuracy with which the 
full-length NART and Short NART predicted WAIS IQs, revealed that the 
superiority of the former was very minimal. It is concluded that, despite some 
reservations regarding the Short NART's practical utility, it can be used with 
reasonable confidence in clinical practice to estimate premorbid IQ.

Near-fatal asthma.

Molfino NA(1), Slutsky AS.

Author information:
(1)Toronto Hospital Asthma Centre, Ontario, Canada.

The prevalence of patients with acute severe asthma appears to be increasing in 
many countries. In the present review, we summarize data in the literature 
relating to the prevention and treatment of fatality-prone asthmatics. The 
underlying assumption is that increased understanding of near-fatal asthma will 
increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of severe asthma, and lead to 
interventions that could reduce the mortality rate from asthma. Recognition of 
acute life-threatening asthma attacks by any physician is mandatory, since lack 
of such diagnosis and appropriate treatment has been shown to have devastating 
consequences. The characteristics that allow identification of asthmatics prone 
to die in ambulatory settings (i.e. previous admissions, type of therapy, etc.) 
as well as the principal precipitating factors of acute near-fatal and fatal 
attacks of asthma are reviewed. Predisposing factors, such as lack of 
appropriate treatment, lack of compliance or poor preventive measures are 
debated. Finally, we discuss current therapeutic approaches in emergency 
facilities, based on the major pathophysiological findings in near-fatal asthma.

How and why we age.

After performing the miracles that takes us from conception to birth, and then 
to sexual maturation and adulthood, natural selection was unable to favor the 
development of a more elementary mechanism that would simply maintain those 
earlier miracles forever. The manifestations of this failure are called aging. 
Because few feral animals age, evolution could not have favored a genetic 
program for age changes. Natural selection favors animals that are most likely 
to become reproductively successful by developing better survival strategies and 
greater reserve capacity in vital systems to better escape predation, disease, 
accidents, and environmental extremes. Natural selection diminishes after 
reproductive success because the species will not benefit from members favored 
for greater longevity. The level of physiological reserve remaining after 
reproductive maturity determines longevity and evolves incidental to the 
selection process that acts on earlier developmental events. Physiological 
reserve does not renew at the same rate that it incurs losses because molecular 
disorder increases at a rate greater than the capacity for repair. These are age 
changes, and they increase vulnerability to predation, accidents, or disease. 
Failure to distinguish aging from disease has not only blurred our efforts to 
understand the fundamental biology of aging, but it has profound political and 
economic consequences that compromise the field of biogerontology. Changes 
attributable to disease, or pathological change, can be distinguished from age 
changes for at least four important reasons. Unlike any known disease, (1) age 
changes occur in every human given sufficient time, (2) age changes cross 
virtually all species barriers, (3) no disease afflicts all members of a species 
only after the age of reproductive success, and (4) aging occurs in all feral 
animals subsequently protected by humans, even when that species probably has 
not experienced aging for thousands or millions of years. The resolution of 
age-associated diseases will not advance our knowledge of aging, just as the 
resolution of the diseases of childhood did not advance our knowledge of 
childhood development. We have failed to convey that greater support must be 
given to a question that is rarely posed. It is a question that is applicable to 
all age-associated diseases, and its resolution will also advance our 
fundamental knowledge of aging: ""Why are old cells more vulnerable to pathology 
and disease than are young cells?"" During the first half of this century it was 
believed that because cultured normal cells were immortal, aging must be caused 
by extra-cellular events. Thirty-five years ago we overthrough this dogma when 
we found that normal cells do have a limited capacity to divide, and that age 
changes can occur intracellularly. We also observed that only abnormal or cancer 
cells are immortal. Normal cells are mortal because telomeres shorten at each 
division. Immortal cancer cells express the enzyme telomerase that prevents 
shortening. Recently, it was discovered that when the catalytic subunit of the 
telomerase gene is inserted into normal cells they become immortal.

Laser versus electrical cautery in the treatment of condylomata acuminata of the 
anus.

Billingham RP, Lewis FG.

Thirty-eight patients with condylomata acuminata of the anus, requiring surgical 
therapy, had the left half of the anus treated with conventional electrical 
cautery, while the right half of the anus was treated with the carbon dioxide 
laser at the same time. Patients were questioned about the amount of pain on 
both sides and were studied for evidence of recurrence. The laser was associated 
with either more pain or the same amount of pain when compared with that of 
electrical cautery. Recurrences were first seen more often on the laser side. 
The cost of the laser treatment to the patient was higher by $50. it is 
concluded that the laser offers no advantage and may, indeed, be less effective 
than the conventional electrical cautery in the treatment of condylomata 
acuminata of the anus.

Molecular cloning of a novel mRNA (neuronatin) that is highly expressed in 
neonatal mammalian brain.

Hospital, Detroit, MI.

As differential gene expression governs the progression of development into 
senescence, we attempted to define the genes that are selectively expressed 
during postnatal brain development. A cDNA fragment selectively expressed in 
neonatal rat brain was identified by differential display and used to screen a 
cDNA library prepared from the same mRNA sample. The full length cDNA, 
neuronatin, was 1195bp long and coded for a novel protein of 81 amino acids. The 
cDNA detected an mRNA species of similar size that was highly expressed in rat 
neonatal and human fetal brain. The deduced protein exhibited a hydrophobic 
N-terminal and hydrophilic C-terminal, suggesting that it is membrane bound and 
might function in signal transduction. The selective expression of this novel 
mRNA in late fetal and early postnatal brain development, and loss of expression 
in adulthood and senescence, suggests that downregulation of neuronatin may be 
involved in terminal brain differentiation.

To assess the effect of age and disease on mineral distribution at the distal 
third of the tibia, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) 
were measured at lumbar spine (spine), femoral neck (neck), and diaphysis (Dia) 
and distal epiphysis (Epi) of the tibia in 89 healthy control women of different 
age groups (20-29, n = 12; 30-39, n = 11; 40-44, n = 12; 45-49, n = 12; 50-54, n 
= 12; 55-59, n = 10; 60-69, n = 11; 70-79, n = 9), in 25 women with untreated 
vertebral osteoporosis (VOP), and in 19 women with primary hyperparathyroidism 
(PHPT) using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; Hologic QDR 1000 and 
standard spine software). A soft tissue simulator was used to compensate for 
heterogeneity of soft tissue thickness around the leg. Tibia was scanned over a 
length of 130 mm from the ankle joint, fibula being excluded from analysis. For 
BMC and BMD, 10 sections 13 mm each were analyzed separately and then pooled to 
define the epiphysis (Epi 13-52 mm) and diaphysis area (Dia 91-130 mm). 
Precision after repositioning was 1.9 and 2.1% for Epi and Dia, respectively. In 
the control group, at any site there was no significant difference between age 
groups 20-29 and 30-39, which thus were pooled to define the peak bone mass 
(PBM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

[Neurochemical and electroencephalographical studies on the central actions of 
mianserin (author's transl)].

[Article in Japanese]

Sakai Y, Matsui Y.

A new antidepressant, mianserin (GB-94, Organon), and other known 
antidepressants, imipramine (IMP), desipramine (DPM), chlorimipramine (CIP), 
amitriptyline (ATP) and nortriptyline (NTP) were orally administered to 
respective groups of 25 mice for consecutive weeks, and changes in monoamine 
metabolisms in the brain were investigated, neurochemically. On the basis of 
significant difference from the control group, mianserin 20 mg/kg and DPM 20 
mg/kg produced no change of the brain contents of DA and 5-HT; IMP 50 mg/kg and 
CIP 40 mg/kg did not alter NA and DA values, but did decrease 5-HT levels; ATP 
30 mg/kg increased only the amount of NA, left unchanged the DA and 5-HT levels, 
and NTP 20 mg/kg raised the levels of DA and 5-HT, but had no effect on NA. 
Mianserin, IMP and DPM all facilitated the decrease of both NE and DA as induced 
by pre-administration of alpha-methyltyrosine, the substance known to reduce the 
level of catecholamines. Both NTP and CTP showed no notable effect. ATP 
suppressed the reduction of the DA level. Accumulation of 5-HIAA induced 1 hour 
after treatment with probenecid 250 mg/kg was enhanced by mianserin 20 mg/kg, 
NTP 20/kg and IMP 25 mg/kg, but was not significantly affected by CIP, DPM and 
ATP. These results suggest that mianserin activated both the NE and 5-HT 
metabolic systems, IMP activated the NE system in general, but activated the 
5-HT system only at low doses and tended to suppress the formation of 5-HT, in 
high doses; CIP had no effect on the NE system and suppressed 5-HT system, in 
high doses. The arousal response of hippocampal EEG in the chronic EEG of the 
rabbit, induced by physostigmine 0.05 mg/kg, i.v., was suppressed by IMP, ATP 
and CIP, while DMP and NTP were uneffected. Mianserin, rather maintained and 
prolong the arousal reaction. Observations made on arousal and sleep phases in 
long time recording of chronic spontaneous EEG in the rat showed a 
dose-dependent shortening of the para-sleep phase by mianserin in doses over 30 
mg/kg and IMP in doses over 5 mg/kg. ATP 15 mg/kg showed a tendency to shorten 
the para-sleep. Hippocampal and cerebral cortical EEGs at arousal and slow wave 
stages were analyzed using a signal processor. The power spectra thus obtained 
showed no significant difference between the effects of mianserin and IMP.

Patients who cannot secrete ABO and Lewis blood group antigens into body fluids, 
an ability controlled by a single gene on chromosome 19, are known to be at 
increased risk of certain autoimmune diseases associated with human leucocyte 
antigen (HLA) markers. This study investigated the possibility of an association 
with coeliac disease using red cell Lewis (Le) blood group phenotype to infer 
secretor status. Among 73 patients with coeliac disease who had Le a or b 
antigen, 48% were non-secretors (Le a + b-) compared with 27% of 137 blood 
donors (p = 0.004: odds ratio 2.49, 95% confidence intervals 1.37 to 4.51) and 
26% of 62 medical and nursing staff controls (p = 0.014: odds ratio 2.65, 95% 
confidence intervals 1.27 to 5.50). Clinical characteristics did not differ 
between secretors and non-secretors with coeliac disease. Thus, the non-secretor 
state is significantly associated with coeliac disease, suggesting that genes on 
chromosome 19 may directly or indirectly participate in conferring 
susceptibility.

Posture, age, menopause, and osteopenia do not influence the circadian variation 
in the urinary excretion of pyridinium crosslinks.

(1)Center for Clinical and Basic Research, Ballerup, Denmark.

This study was performed to investigate whether the circadian variation in 
urinary pyridinium crosslinks is related to physical activity, age, the 
menopause, and asymptomatic osteopenia. We measured urinary 
pyridinoline/creatinine (Pyr/Cr) and deoxypyridinoline/creatinine (D-Pyr/Cr) in 
9 healthy premenopausal women in two 27 h studies, before and at the end of 5 
days of total bed rest. Both Pyr/Cr and D-Pyr/Cr showed highly significant 
circadian variations, with the peak at night and the nadir during the day (p < 
0.001). The 5 days of complete bed rest produced no changes in the circadian 
pattern, but a general increase of 28% was observed in pyridinium crosslinks. A 
group of 12 healthy, early postmenopausal women (aged 55 +/- 2 years), 12 
healthy, elderly postmenopausal women (aged 73 +/- 1 years), and 12 elderly 
osteopenic but otherwise healthy women (aged 73 +/- 1 years) were also studied 
for 27 h. All three groups showed highly significant (p < or = 0.001) circadian 
variations in the urinary excretion of pyridinium crosslinks. As expected, both 
Pyr/Cr (p < 0.05) and D-Pyr/Cr (p < 0.001) increased at the time of menopause, 
but the circadian variations in Pyr/Cr and D-Pyr/Cr were similar in all groups 
studied. We conclude that the circadian variation in the urinary excretion of 
pyridinium crosslinks is independent of physical factors. Furthermore, the 
circadian variation in pyridinium crosslinks was not related to age, menopausal 
status, or asymptomatic osteopenia.

Evaluation of the extent of heterogeneity in the Glycera dibranchiata monomer 
haemoglobin fraction by the use of n.m.r. and ion-exchange chromatography.

Kandler RL, Constantinidis I, Satterlee JD.

The coelomic haemoglobin of Glycera dibranchiata is known to be separable into 
monomeric and higher-Mr fractions. Although exhibiting homogeneity with respect 
to Mr, the extent of haemoglobin heterogeneity for the monomer fraction has 
never been adequately assayed. In the present paper we demonstrate that there 
exists in the monomer haemoglobin fraction reproducibly detectable heterogeneity 
regardless of the presence or absence of proteinase inhibitors during the 
isolations. These results show that, considered on the same time scale as 
previous preparations used for amino acid sequencing, crystallography and 
kinetics, the monomer haemoglobin fraction is highly heterogeneous. Application 
of ion-exchange chromatography and ion-filtration methods resulted in the 
isolation of four resolvable haem protein components from the Glycera monomer 
haemoglobin fraction. Three of these components were isolated in sufficient 
quantity to employ proton n.m.r. as a successful analytical tool for 
discriminating the individual haemoglobins. These results are not surprising. 
Several previous studies indicated less extensive heterogeneity in the monomer 
fraction. Moreover, the ability of the Glycera monomer haemoglobin to bind 
oxygen at even quite low partial pressures has been attributed to functional 
diversity originating in multiple haemoglobin components. The present work 
reveals the extent of the haemoglobin heterogeneity. The results show that it is 
more extensive than previously believed. Examination of this monomer fraction is 
particularly important, since crystallography indicates that one of the 
components of the monomer fraction lacks the E-7 (distal) histidine residue. As 
a consequence, the identification of such extensive heterogeneity is important 
to many previously published ligand-binding studies.

A phylogenetic study of the structural and functional characteristics of 
corticosteroid binding globulin in primates.

Robinson PA, Hawkey C, Hammond GL.

A monospecific antiserum against human corticosteroid binding globulin (hCBG) 
has been used to identify structural similarities between hCBG and CBG in the 
blood of other primates and representative species of different vertebrate 
classes. Double immunodiffusion analysis indicated that only CBG in Old World 
monkeys and apes cross-react with the hCBG antiserum. This was confirmed by a 
solid-phase radioimmunoassay for hCBG which also demonstrated that CBG in apes 
is immunologically identical to hCBG and that Old World monkey CBG comprises 
most, but not all, of the hCBG epitopes. The electrophoretic mobilities of 
human, gorilla and gibbon CBG were similar (RF 0.50-0.51), but differed from Old 
World monkey CBG (RF 0.44-0.49) and chimpanzee CBG (RF 0.47). Although 
serum/plasma cortisol binding capacities were similar in Old World primates, the 
dissociation half-times (t 1/2) of cortisol were higher from human and ape CBG 
(18-25 min) than from Old World monkey CBG (14-18 min). The steroid binding 
specificities of human and ape (CBG corticosterone greater than cortisol greater 
than progesterone greater than or equal to testosterone) were also different 
from those of Old World monkey CBG (corticosterone much greater than cortisol 
approximately equal to progesterone greater than testosterone). Lemur plasma 
cortisol binding capacity and CBG dissociation t 1/2 of cortisol were similar to 
hCBG, but its steroid binding specificity was different (cortisol greater than 
corticosterone greater than progesterone greater than or equal to testosterone) 
and it did not cross-react with the hCBG antiserum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

Administration of heparin to rats with 1 3/4 nephrectomy prevents the 
development of glomerulosclerosis, hypertension and retards the decrease in 
renal function seen in these rats. To further define the role of hypertension 
and/or coagulation in the pathogenesis of the glomerulopathy seen in this model 
we studied several groups of rats with 1 3/4 nephrectomy: (1) a control group; 
(2) a group receiving a 'high dose' of acetylsalicylic acid (50 mg/kg) plus 
dipyridamole (10 mg/kg); (3) a group receiving a 'low' dose (5 mg/kg body 
weight) of acetylsalicylic acid alone; (4) a group receiving OKY 1581, an 
inhibitor of thromboxane synthesis; (5) a group treated with antihypertensive 
medications; (6) a group receiving heparin subcutaneously twice daily, and (7) a 
group given oral Coumadin. Drugs in all groups were administered daily for 4 
weeks. All treated groups had a decrease in blood pressure (BP), in the ratio of 
heart weight to body weight, in BUN levels and had fewer abnormal glomeruli. The 
effects of acetylsalicylic acid alone, of acetylsalicylic acid plus 
dipyridamole, and OKY 1581 may be due to inhibition of platelet aggregation and 
intraglomerular thrombosis, with the fall in BP being the consequence of 
improved renal function. On the other hand, the decrease in BP may be related to 
a primary effect of these drugs. The lower BP in turn may play a role in slowing 
the progression of renal disease and improving the renal histology in the 
treated groups.

BACKGROUND: The thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is not 
included in the national immunization program and is administered voluntarily 
with informed consent in China. In preparation for assessing the impact of pilot 
introduction in Hainan Province, we conducted a carriage study among children 
under 5 years of age from four locations in Hainan Province, China.
METHODS: From March to June 2022, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, collected from 
healthy children aged younger than 59 months who lived in the 4 different 
locations (Haikou, Wanning, Baisha and Qiongzhong) in Hainan Province, were 
tested for pneumococcus using conventional culture. Pneumococcal isolates were 
serotyped using the Quellung reaction. Risk factors associated with pneumococcal 
colonization were assessed using univariate analysis and multivariable logistic 
regression adjusting for age, daycare attendance and other factors.
RESULTS: Pneumococcus was isolated in 710 (30.4%) of the 2333 children enrolled. 
Of 737 pneumococci, 29 serotypes were identified; 60.9% were PCV13 serotypes; 
the most common vaccine serotypes were 6B (20.4%), 19F (13.0%), 6A (11.9%) and 
23F (6.1%); and the most common nonvaccine serotypes were 23A (12.9%), 34 (6.1%) 
and nontypeable (NT) pneumococci (5.6%). Children vaccinated with PCV13 had 
lower carriage (17.7% vs 32.5%; P = 0.0001) and fewer PCV13 serotypes (41.9% vs 
62.7%; P = 0.0017) compared to unimmunized children. After adjustment, NP 
carriage was higher among children attending daycare (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 
1.7-3.2), living in rural areas (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.8), living with 
siblings (aOR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0-1.6) and whose mothers had completed senior 
high/technical secondary school (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.0). In contrast, 
completion of 3-4 doses of PCV13 were associated with a lower carriage rate 
(aOR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4-0.9).
CONCLUSIONS: We established the baseline of pneumococcal carriage, serotype 
distribution and PCV13 immunization rates among healthy children under 5 years 
of age in Hainan Province, prior to the introduction of PCV13 into the national 
immunization program. The high proportion of PCV13 serotypes suggests that PCV13 
introduction will likely have a substantial impact on pneumococcal carriage in 
Hainan Province.

PURPOSE: Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) is a major cause of child death. We 
investigated the epidemiology of S. pneumoniae in a pediatric fever clinic and 
explored the genomics basis of the limited vaccine response of serotype 14 
strains worldwide.
METHODS: Febrile disease and pneumonia were diagnosed following criteria from 
the WHO at the end of 2019 at a tertiary children's hospital. Spn was isolated 
by culture from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. The density was determined by 
lytA-base qPCR. Isolates were serotyped by Quellung and underwent antimicrobial 
susceptibility testing. Whole-genome sequencing was employed for molecular 
serotyping, MLST, antibiotic gene determination, SNP calling, recombination 
prediction, and phylogenetic analysis.
RESULTS: The presence of pneumococcus in the nasopharynx (87.5%, 7/8, 
p = 0.0227) and a high carriage (100%, 7/7, p = 0.0123) were significantly 
associated with pneumonia development. Living with siblings (73.7%, 14/19, 
p = 0.0125) and non-vaccination (56.0%, 28/50, p = 0.0377) contributed 
significantly to the Spn carriage. Serotype 14 was the most prevalent strain 
(16.67%, 5/30). The genome analysis of 1497 serotype 14 strains indicated 
S14/ST876 strains were only prevalent in China, presented limited vaccine 
responses with higher recombination activities within its cps locus, and unique 
variation patterns in the genes wzg and lrp.
CONCLUSION: With the lifting of the one-child policy, it will be crucial for 
families with multiple children to get PCV vaccinations in China. Due to the 
highly variant cps locus and distinctive variation patterns in capsule shedding 
and binding proteins genes, the prevalent S14/ST876 strains have shown poor 
response to current vaccines. It is necessary to continue monitoring the 
molecular epidemiology of this vaccine escape clone.

BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important pathogen causing high 
morbidity and high mortality in children and undergoes frequent recombination 
for capsule switching to neutralize the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(PCV13). This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, and molecular 
characteristics including serotypes and antibiotic susceptibility of S. 
pneumoniae isolated from children living in Southwest China from 2017 to 2019 to 
facilitate the selection of effective vaccine formulations and appropriate 
antibiotic treatment regimens.
METHODS: This study was conducted at West China Second University Hospital 
(Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China), Zunyi Medical University Third Affiliated 
Hospital/First People's Hospital of Zunyi (Zunyi, Guizhou Province, China) and 
Chengdu Jinjiang District Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital (Chengdu, 
Sichuan Province, China). Demographic and clinical characteristics of children 
infected with S. pneumoniae were collected and analysed. Next-generation 
sequencing and sequence analysis were used to determine the serotypes, sequence 
types, antibiotic resistance and potential protein vaccine target genes of the 
pneumococcal isolates. The coverage rate provided by PCV13 was estimated by 
calculating the percentage of the specific serotypes that were specifically the 
PCV13-included serotypes. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the 
microdilution broth method.
RESULTS: The most prevalent pneumococcal serotypes were 19F (25.8%), 19A 
(14.1%), 6B (12.5%), 6A (9.4%) and 14 (7.8%). The predominant STs were ST271 
(23.3%), ST320 (15.5%) and ST90 (8.6%), dominated by the clonal complex 
Taiwan19F-14 (39.1%). The coverage rate of PCV13 was 77.3% in all the isolates, 
with relatively higher values in invasive isolates (86.4%). Over the decade, the 
rates of resistance to penicillin, amoxicillin and cefotaxime were 5.6%, 5.3% 
and 5.1%, respectively, with significantly higher values in invasive isolates 
(22.4%, 14.9% and 11.9%). Almost all the isolates were resistant to erythromycin 
(99.1%) and clindamycin (95.9%). All isolates carried virulence-related genes, 
including ply, psaA, piaA, piuA, phtE, nanA, pepO, danJ, pvaA, clpP, pcsB, stkP, 
potD, and strH. The carriage of virulence and resistance genes varied among 
serotypes and clades, with serotype 19F/ST271 showing higher resistance to 
antibiotics and being more likely to carry pilus genes and other virulence 
genes.
CONCLUSION: These data provide valuable information for the understanding of 
pneumococcal pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance and the development of 
protein-based vaccines against pneumococcal infection.

BACKGROUND: In China, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) has been 
available since 2017, but only via the private market with low uptake rate. We 
assessed the direct effectiveness of PCV13 against community acquired pneumonia 
(CAP) associated with PCV13 serotype carriage (VT-CAP).
METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of children born during 
12-Dec-2016 to 30-Nov-2018 identified in the Suzhou Centers for Disease Control 
vaccine registry database, and who had at least one inpatient or outpatient 
record at the Suzhou University Affiliated Children's hospital (SCH) 
health-information-system (HIS) database. The vaccine registry cohort was 
followed through the HIS database through 30-Jun-2019 to identify hospitalized 
VT-CAP. Pneumococci were isolated from deep upper respiratory aspirates and 
serotyped with Quellung reactions.
RESULTS: We included 139,127 children of whom 9024 (6.5%) received 1 + PCV13 
doses (95.8% received 2 + doses). Within the total cohort, we identified 548 
children hospitalized at SCH for VT-CAP, of whom 10 had received 2 + PCV13 
doses. Adjusted for demographics, receipt of other childhood vaccines, and 
underlying medical conditions, the first visit vaccine effectiveness among 
children who had received 2 + PCV13 doses was 60.9% (95% CI: 25.8% to 79.4%) for 
VT-CAP and 17.9% (95% CI: 5.5% to 28.6%) for clinical CAP. Incidence rate 
reductions per 100,000 child-years of observation for all visits were 208 (95% 
CI: 118 to 298) for VT-CAP and 720 (95% CI: 304 to 1135) for clinical CAP.
CONCLUSIONS: PCV13 was protective against hospitalized VT-CAP and clinical CAP 
with large associated incidence rate reductions among children living in Suzhou, 
China.

OBJECTIVE: To study the clustering and influencing factors of Streptococcus 
pneumoniae carriage among kindergarten children, and to provide a scientific 
basis for the prevention of pneumococcal diseases.
METHODS: The multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method was used to collect 
nasal swabs via the nasal vestibule at both sides from 1 702 kindergarten 
children in Liuzhou, China. A questionnaire survey was performed on their 
parents. The chi-square test and the random effects logistic regression analysis 
were used to analyze data.
RESULTS: The carriage rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 13.16% (224/1 702) 
among kindergarten children. The clustering analysis showed that the class-level 
random effect of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage was statistically significant 
(Z=2.07, P=0.038), with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 5.9%. The 
random effects logistic regression analysis showed that the children aged 5-7 
years had a lower risk of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage than those aged 2-< 
5 years (OR=0.55, 95%CI:0.40-0.76, P=0.001), and the children with ≥ 5 family 
members living together had a higher risk of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage 
than those with < 5 family members (OR=1.34, 95%CI:1.01-1.79, P=0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage shows a class-level clustering 
effect, and age and the number of cohabitants are important influencing factors 
for Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage in children.

Background:Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen causing death in 
children under 5 years old. This retrospective surveillance aimed to analyze 
serotype distribution, drug resistance, virulence factors, and molecular 
characteristics of pneumonia isolates from children in Shanghai, China. Methods: 
A total of 287 clinical pneumococcal isolates were collected from January to 
December in 2018 and were divided into community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 
healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) two groups according to where someone 
contracts the infection. All isolates were serotyped by multiplex sequential PCR 
and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using E-test or disk 
diffusion method. The molecular epidemiology was analyzed using multilocus 
sequence typing and seven housekeeping genes were sequenced to identified the 
sequence types (STs). In addition, we investigated the presence of virulence 
genes via PCR. Results: The most common serotypes were 19F, 6A, 19A, 23F, 14, 
and 6B, and the coverage rates of the 7-, 10- and 13-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccines were 58.9, 58.9, and 80.5%, respectively. More PCV13/non-PCV7 
serotypes and higher rate of penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae were seen 
in HAP. Molecular epidemiological typing showed a high level of diversity and 
five international antibiotic-resistant clones were found, including 
Taiwan19F-14, Spain23F-1, Spain6B-2, Taiwan23F-15 and Sweden15A-25. No 
significant difference was observed in the presence of virulence genes among the 
isolates obtained from CAP and HAP. All of the S. pneumoniae isolates carried 
lytA, ply, psaA, pavA, spxB, htrA, and clpP, and the carriage rate of nanA and 
piaA were 96.2 and 99.0%. Conversely, cps2A, cbpA, and pspA were present in 
33.8-44.3% of the isolates. Conclusions: Serotype changes and emerging 
multidrug-resistant international clones were found in current study. lytA, ply, 
psaA, pavA, spxB, htrA, and clpP may be good protein vaccine candidates. 
Long-term high-quality surveillance should be conducted to assess impact and 
effectiveness brought by vaccines, and provide a foundation for prevention 
strategies and vaccine policies.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the most common respiratory pathogen 
worldwide. Nasopharyngeal carriage with S. pneumoniae is the major source of 
lower respiratory tract infection and horizontal spread among children. 
Investigating nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae is crucial for clinicians to control 
pneumococcus disease. Here, we retrospectively analyzed clinical information of 
5,960 hospitalized children, focusing on pneumonia children less than five years 
with positive nasopharyngeal pneumococcal cultures. Nasopharyngeal aspirates 
(NPAs) were collected between June 2009 and December 2016, which were outside 
the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine(PCV) period. NPAs were subjected to common 
bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility tests, and serotypes were 
identified by both multiplex PCR and DNA sequencing. Results clearly revealed 
that clinical manifestations of the children whose NPAs were S. pneumoniae 
culture positive were serious, especially in those less than twelve months old. 
Fifteen different serotypes of nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae were detected, the 
most common ones being 19F (35.2%), 6A/B (23.8%), 19A (11.4%), 15B/C (9.3%) and 
23F (7.8%). Eight serotypes, accounting for 85.5% of the isolates, corresponded 
to the PCV13 serotypes. Approximately one-third of all S. pneumoniae strains 
were susceptible to penicillin. Overall, we consider nasopharyngeal S. 
pneumoniae culture is beneficial in assessing the situations of pneumonia 
children. Moreover, PCV13 could be useful in preventing pneumococcal disease in 
Chongqing, China.

The carriage rate and serotype distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. 
pneumoniae) in a healthy population in China remains unclear. In this study, we 
collected the oropharyngeal swabs from 513 individuals in Xinjiang, China. 
Real-time PCR targeting the lytA gene and 12 serotypes were assessed to identify 
S. pneumoniae carriage. The total carriage rate of S. pneumoniae was 70.4% 
(361/513). The most prevalent serotypes were 19B/F, 18B/C, 5, and 6A/B. The 
highest carriage rate of S. pneumoniae was noted in children aged 6-10 years 
(88.6%), which merits further attention. The co-colonization rate of two or more 
S. pneumoniae serotypes was 79.8% (264/331). This study aimed to investigate the 
baseline pneumococcal carriage rate among healthy individuals in China to 
improve our understanding of the epidemiology of S. pneumoniae.

BACKGROUND: To explore the overall prevalence and serotype distribution of 
nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae(S. pneumoniae) among healthy 
children.
METHODS: A search for pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage studies including 
children published up to July 31th, 2016 was conducted to describe carriage in 
China. The review also describes antibiotic resistance in and serotypes of S. 
pneumoniae and assesses the impact of vaccination on carriage in this region. 
Summary measures for overall prevalence, antibiotic resistance, and serotype 
distributions extracted from the analyzed data were determined with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was 
assessed using I 2 test statistics.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies were included in this review, and the majority of 
studies (64.9%) were located in the pre-introduction period of 7-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in China. The pooled prevalence of S. 
pneumoniae nasopharyngeal carriage was 21.4% (95% CI: 18.3-24.4%). Carriage was 
highest in children attending kindergartens [24.5%, (19.7-29.3%)] and decreased 
with increasing age. Before the introduction of PCV7 into China, the prevalence 
of S. pneumoniae nasopharyngeal carriage was 25.8% (20.7-30.9%), the pooled 
carriage of S. pneumoniae sharply dropped into the 14.1% (11.3-16.9%) by PCV7 
vaccination period (P < 0.001). Before the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) 
was introduced in China, the penicillin resistance rate in S. pneumoniae 
isolated from healthy children was 31.9% (21.2-42.6%); however, this rate 
sharply decreased after the introduction of PCV7 in China [21.6%, (7.4-35.9%)], 
and the difference between the rates during these two time periods was 
statistically significant (P value <0.05). Serotypes 19F, 6A and 23F were the 
most commonly isolated. Meta-analysis of data from young children showed a 
pooled rate estimate of 46.6% (38.8-54.4%) for PCV7 vaccine coverage and 66.2% 
(58.6-73.8%) for PCV13 vaccine coverage.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage among children was high 
in China. PCV7 immunization was found to be associated with reduction of 
nasopharyngeal colonization of S. pneumoniae. Conjugate vaccination coverage was 
slightly affected by the introduction of PCV7 into China because of low 
vaccination rate. The government should implement timely adjusted conjugate 
vaccination strategies based on our findings.

BACKGROUND: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is an important cause of 
invasive bacterial disease in children worldwide. The limited awareness of 
disease burden is a major barrier to the introduction of Hib vaccine into 
China's National Immunization Program. Therefore, we conducted a systematic 
review and meta-analysis to estimate carriage of Hib and burden of its related 
diseases in Chinese children.
METHODS: We systematically searched Pubmed, Web of Science, Ovid, Chinese 
National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases for studies 
published up to December 31, 2016, reporting Hib carriage and burden of Hib 
diseases among children in Mainland China. Pooled estimates were obtained using 
random-effects models.
RESULTS: We included 27 studies with 15783 children across 14 provinces. The 
pooled carriage of Hib was 5.87% (95% CI 3.42-8.33) for healthy children. The 
pooled proportion of disease due to Hib were 4.06% (95% CI 3.29-4.83) for acute 
lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) and 27.32% (95% CI 0.41-54.24) for 
bacterial meningitis. The proportion of ALRI caused by Hib was higher in 
northern China than that in the south. Significant heterogeneity was noted 
across and within regions (P<0.001). After the induction of Hib vaccine, 
meta-regression showed that carriage of Hib changed little (P=0.725), but the 
proportion of ALRI caused by Hib in children decreased (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Hib carriage persists at low levels among children in China. The 
proportion of ALRI due to Hib infection decreased with year. Incorporation of 
Hib vaccine into the National Immunization Program could reduce the burden of 
Hib disease in China.

Although mean efficacy of multivalent pneumococcus vaccines has been intensively 
studied, variance in vaccine efficacy (VE) has been overlooked. Different net 
individual protection across settings can be driven by environmental conditions, 
local serotype and clonal composition, as well as by socio-demographic and 
genetic host factors. Understanding efficacy variation has implications for 
population-level effectiveness and other eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Here I show 
that realized VE can vary across epidemiological settings, by applying a 
multi-site-one-model approach to data post-vaccination. I analyse serotype 
prevalence dynamics following PCV7, in asymptomatic carriage in children 
attending day care in Portugal, Norway, France, Greece, Hungary and Hong-Kong. 
Model fitting to each dataset provides site-specific estimates for vaccine 
efficacy against acquisition, and pneumococcal transmission parameters. 
According to this model, variable serotype replacement across sites can be 
explained through variable PCV7 efficacy, ranging from 40% in Norway to 10% in 
Hong-Kong. While the details of how this effect is achieved remain to be 
determined, here I report three factors negatively associated with the VE 
readout, including initial prevalence of serotype 19F, daily mean temperature, 
and the Gini index. The study warrants more attention on local modulators of 
vaccine performance and calls for predictive frameworks within and across 
populations.

BACKGROUND: Nasal colonization with bacterial pathogens is associated with risk 
of invasive respiratory tract infections, but the related information for 
Chinese healthy children is scarce.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with healthy children from 6 
kindergartens in the Chaoshan region, southern China during 2011-2012. Nasal 
swabs were examined for five common bacterial pathogens: Streptococcus 
pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella 
catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus.
RESULTS: Among 1,088 children enrolled, 79.6 % (866) were target-bacterial 
carriers, of which 34.4 % (298/866) were positive for ≥2 bacteria species. The 
most common pathogen in the bacterial carriers was M. catarrhalis (76.6 %), 
followed by S. pneumoniae (26.6 %), S. aureus (21.8 %), H. parainfluenzae 
(12.7 %), and H. influenzae (2.3 %). Multiple logistic regression analyses 
showed negative associations between age and the overall or multiple bacterial 
carriage, and between the father's education level and multiple bacterial 
carriage (all p < 0.05). Age was negatively associated with the carriage of M. 
catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae, and positively associated with the S. aureus 
carriage (all p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows high nasal carriage of common pathogenic bacteria 
and coexistence of multiple pathogens in healthy Chaoshan kindergarten children, 
with M. catarrhalis as the commonest colonizer. Increasing age of children and 
higher paternal education are associated with lower risk of bacterial carriage. 
Longitudinal follow-up studies would be helpful for better understanding the 
infection risk in bacterial pathogen carriers.

A recently published paper that assessed the comparative cost-effectiveness of 
the 2 pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in Malaysia and Hong Kong reported 
that the 13-valent PCV vaccine (PCV13) is a better choice compared to the 
10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate 
vaccine (PHiD-CV or PCV10) from both a payer and societal perspective as well as 
under various scenarios. However, the analysis relied on a large number of 
assumptions that were either erroneous or did not take into account the most 
recent body of evidence available. A rigorous evaluation of the underlying 
assumptions is necessary to present a fair and balanced analysis for 
decision-making.

OBJECTIVES: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has been included in Hong 
Kong's Childhood Immunization Programme since 2009. This study aimed to assess 
nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage rate, serotypes and antimicrobial 
resistance pattern in young children after the introduction of 13-valent PCV 
(PCV13).
STUDY DESIGN: A community-based, cross-sectional surveillance study was 
performed on healthy infants attending eleven Maternal and Child Health Centres 
across different parts of Hong Kong. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 
healthy children aged 2, 12 and 18months during their visit to the centers for 
immunization from June 2013 to June 2014. Pneumococcal isolates were serotyped 
and tested for antimicrobial resistance. Details of the demographics, family 
composition, vaccination history and medical history was obtained through 
interview of the guardians.
RESULTS: 1541 children were recruited. The overall carriage rate was 5.5%. 
Children aged 12 and 18months were more likely to have pneumococcal colonization 
(12months OR: 2.88; 95% CI: 1.41-5.87 and 18months OR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.05-4.57). 
Recent respiratory symptoms and presence of siblings younger than 6years were 
independently associated with pneumococcal carriage. Eighty-four pneumococcal 
isolates were serotyped. The most prevalent serogroup/types were 15 (15B/C, 
16.7%; 15A/F, 9.5%), 6C (15.5%) and 23A (13.1%). Overall, 2.4% of the isolates 
were heptavalent PCV serotypes, 10.7% were PCV13 serotypes and 89.3% were 
non-PCV13 serotypes. The proportions of penicillin, cefotaxime and erythromycin 
non-susceptible isolates were 7.3%, 13.4% and 79.3% respectively.
CONCLUSION: The rate of pneumococcal carriage was low in young children in Hong 
Kong and compared to previous local studies there appears to have been an 
overall reduction in the carriage rate after the introduction of PCV. Likely 
serotype replacement was noted with a predominance of non-vaccine serotypes in 
pneumococcal carriage with the emergence of serogroup/type 15 and 6C.

BACKGROUND: The bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and Haemophilus 
influenzae type b (Hib) are leading causes of childhood pneumonia and meningitis 
and are major contributors to worldwide mortality in children younger than 5 
years of age. Asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcus and Hib was 
determined for healthy children in Shanghai in 2009.
METHODS: Children from 5 immunization clinics were enrolled in this study. 
Specimens from the nasopharynx were collected and cultured in Columbia and 
chocolate agar to identify pneumococcal and Hib carriage. Pneumococcal specimens 
were serotyped with the Neufeld test, and antibiotic resistance for pneumococcal 
and Hib specimens used the E-test method. Significance of risk factors for 
carriage was assessed through chi-square tests.
RESULTS: Among 614 children, 16.6% had pneumococcal carriage and 8.0% Hib 
carriage. The predominant serotype of pneumococcus that was isolated was 19 F 
(52.9%); serotype coverage was 68.6% for both 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (PCV) and PCV-10, and 82.3% for PCV-13. Household residency and father's 
education were both significantly related to pneumococcal and Hib carriage. The 
majority of S. pneumoniae isolates were sensitive to most antimicrobials but 
there were high levels of resistance to azithromycin (51.0 %) and erythromycin 
(51.0%). Haemophilus influenzae isolates were sensitive to almost all 
antimicrobials tested although 12.2% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin.
CONCLUSIONS: The pneumococcal and Hib vaccines require payment, and the children 
with the highest burden of disease may not be receiving these vaccines. 
Moreover, the presence of high antibiotic susceptibility towards pneumococcus, 
and to a lesser extent towards Hib, underscores the need for preventive 
protection against these diseases. Public funding of pneumococcal and Hib 
vaccines would be one mechanism to increase uptake of these vaccines.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the molecular epidemiology of pneumococcal isolates 
in Chongqing, China.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 51 invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. 
pneumoniae) strains were from children with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) 
and 32 carriage strains from healthy children from January 2010 to December 2013 
at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. 
Multilocus sequence typing was used to identify the sequence types (STs). 
Capsular serotypes were determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Drug 
susceptibility and resistance was determined by minimum inhibitory 
concentrations.
RESULTS: In this study, 11 serotypes were identified among the 83 S. pneumoniae 
clinical isolates tested. Prevalent serotypes were 19A (20.4%), 6A/B (20.4%), 
19F (15.7%), 14 (14.5%), and 23F (10.8%). Serotype 19F was the most frequent 
carriage strain, and serotype 19A was the most frequent invasive strain. The 
ST983 was the most prevalent ST for carriage strains, and ST320 was the most 
prevalent ST for invasive strains. For gene analysis, psaA (99.5%) and piaA 
(98.6%) were present and much conserved in all pneumococci tested. The cps2A and 
pcsB genes were more frequent in invasive isolates than carriage strains. 
Antimicrobial resistance rates of invasive pneumococcal isolates to 
erythromycin, penicillin, meropenem, cefotaxime, and clindamycin were higher 
than the carriage isolates from children.
CONCLUSION: Our epidemiological evidence shows that 19A, 6A/B, 19F, 14, and 23F 
remain the most prevalent serotypes, which can be targeted by PCV13. Genotypes 
and drug resistance varied between carriage and invasive strains. The PsaA and 
PiaA may be good protein vaccine candidates.

This study assessed pneumococcal carriage in the early periods after routine use 
of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in Hong Kong. Nasopharyngeal 
swabs were obtained from 1110 children (<5 years) admitted with acute illness 
during September 2010-August 2013. Pneumococcal carriage rate was 13.5% in 
unvaccinated children, 14.1% in children who had ≥1 PCV dose and 15.3% in 
children who had ≥3 PCV doses. Nonv-PCV13 serotypes comprised 56.4% of all 
isolates. The most common serogroup/types were 15 (15A, 5.1%; 15B, 10.3%; 15C, 
9.6%; 15F, 0.6%), 19F (17.9%), 6A (7.1%) and 6C (7.1%). Carriage of serogroup 15 
was more common among vaccinated children (4.1% versus 0.6%, P = 0.033). 
Molecular typing revealed that expansion of several clones (clonal complex, 
CC63, CC199, CC1262, CC3397) was responsible for the increase in serogroup 15. 
Almost all CC63 and CC3397 isolates were nonsusceptible to both penicillin and 
erythromycin. The finding highlights the emergence of serogroup 15 following 
PCV13 use.

Serogroup 15 pneumococcal isolates from nasopharyngeal carriage of hospitalized 
children admitted to a teaching hospital in Hong Kong from April 2009 to 
September 2013 were characterized by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), 
multilocus sequence typing, and antimicrobial non-susceptibility testing. The 
overall proportion of serogroup 15 isolates in the pre-PCV7 and post-PCV13 
periods rose from 5.7% to 20.0%. The increase in trend for serotype 15B/C was 
statistically significant among children presented with pneumonia; 
bronchiolitis; upper respiratory tract infection; and febrile, non-respiratory 
diseases and for serotype 15A/F, among children with bronchiolitis and febrile, 
non-respiratory diseases. The predominant PFGE cluster of serotype 15B/C 
belonged to sequence type (ST) 199. Replacement of this more susceptible cluster 
(Ery and Tet non-susceptibilities of 32.2% and 25.4%) with the non-susceptible 
cluster, ST8859 (Ery and Tet non-susceptibilities of 91.7% and 87.5%) was noted. 
ST63 was the predominant serotype 15A cluster (Ery and Tet non-susceptibilities 
of 97.4% and 92.3%). Serogroup 15 subtypes have emerged in the post-PCV13 era, 
and these non-susceptible clusters warrant closer monitoring as candidates for 
incorporation to future pneumococcal vaccines.

Active surveillance on nasopharygeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in 
children was conducted in 5581 children under 16 years old admitted with 
respiratory illness to the pediatric wards in a Hong Kong teaching hospital 
during 2008-2010. The isolation rate of S. pneumoniae was 14.5%. The most common 
serotypes/groups from 911 isolates were 19F, 6B, 23F, 14, 6C, 6A, and 3. 
Considering only children under 2 years old, the percentage serotype belonging 
to that of the 7-, 10- and 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccines in S. 
pneumoniae were 56.0% (115/205), 57% (117/205), and 80.5% (165/205), 
respectively. The prevalence of penicillin-nonsusceptibility (MIC ≥4.0 μg/mL) 
was 9.1% and for cefotaxime (MIC ≥2.0 μg/mL) was 14.7%. A high prevalence of 
non-6B serotype, including 6A, 6C, and 6D was noted after the introduction of 
PCV7 conjugate pneumococcal vaccines in Hong Kong.

This study assessed the changes in serotype distribution and antibiotic 
resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in children before and after 
introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in Hong Kong. 
Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from 1978 and 2211 children (ages, 2 to 
6 years) attending day care centers or kindergartens in period 1 (1999-2000) and 
period 2 (2009-2010), respectively. Carriage of PCV7 serotypes decreased from 
12.8% to 8.6% (P < 0.01). The relative contribution of PCV7 serotypes 14 and 18C 
had decreased, whereas that for non-PCV7 serotypes 19A, 6A, 6C, 23A, and 15B had 
increased. In period 2, PCV7 penetration rate (at least 1 dose) for children 
aged 2, 3, 4, and 5 years was 43%, 35.7%, 26.7%, and 20.4%, respectively. In 
multivariate analysis, PCV7 use was the only independent variable associated 
with fewer PCV7 serotype carriages (odds ratio 0.5; P = 0.001). In period 2, 
high rates of dual penicillin/erythromycin nonsusceptibility were found in 
serotypes 6B (77.3%), 14 (100%), 19F (100%), 23F (78%), 19A (75%), 6A (87.8%), 
6C (59.3%), and 23A (78.9%).

In order to evaluate immunogenicity and protective efficacy of LytA from 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, we subcloned the full-length lytA-encoded autolysin 
(LytA) from 5 major pathogenic serotype isolates in China and obtained purified 
rLytA. Bioinformatics analysis showed that sequences of LytA were highly 
conserved in all strains we used in this work, and western blot analysis 
demonstrated that rLytAs from heterogeneous serotypes were cross-recognized by 
serum of mice infected with 23F strain SH137. Mice were intranasally immunized 
with purified rLytA, and serum anti-rLytA IgG, IgA and secretory IgA were 
elicited. More importantly, rLytA intranasal-immunized mice showed a 
significantly higher survival rate and lower bacterial carriage in response to 
infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The fact that mice immunized with rLytA 
from strain SH137 also had a higher survival rate after intraperitoneal 
injection of other four serotype strains of living S. pneumoniae suggested that 
it possessed cross-protection effect. Our study revealed that intranasal 
immunization with rLytA may protect mice against mucosal and systemic 
pneumococcal infection; hence, it was an attractive vaccine candidate.

The aims of this study were to estimate pneumococcal carriage rate, 
antimicrobial resistance and serogroup distribution of nasopharyngeal isolates 
of Streptococcus pneumoniae among children with acute upper respiratory 
infections (AURIs) aged 1 month to 5 years attending outpatient department of 
the Beijing Children's Hospital between 2000 and 2005. Susceptibilities to 
penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefaclor, 
erythromycin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and chloramphenicol 
were assessed using the E-test and disc diffusion. We also analyzed the 
correlation between antibiotic consumption and rates of resistance. The 
prevalence of penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci increased from 26% during 
2000-2001 and 21% during 2002-2003 to 31.5% in 2004-2005. The percentage of S. 
pneumoniae resistant to cefaclor and cefuroxime increased from about 6% during 
2000-2001 to about 23% during 2004-2005 (P<0.01). The frequency of resistance to 
erythromycin ranged from 87% to 94%. Tetracycline and co-trimoxazole resistance 
rates were greater than 80%. We conclude that resistance rates for most 
antibiotics are increasing, possibly due to misues of antibiotics in the 
hospital setting. However, chloramphenicol resistance was found to decrease, 
which correlated with the cessation of chloramphenicol administration in 1999. 
Pneumococcal strains (n=519) were analyzed by serogroup, and only 296 were found 
to be seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-related serotype isolates. 
This serotype distribution is important for surveillance of the new conjugate 
vaccine.

A study was conducted to determine the vaccine coverage of prevalent carriage 
and invasive pneumococci from children aged less than 6 years in Hong Kong. A 
total of 383 nasopharyngeal carriage isolates and 88 invasive isolates from 
diverse sources were serotyped and their antimicrobial susceptibilities 
determined. The most common carriage serotypes were the same as the invasive 
isolates (6B, 14, 19F and 23F), although the rank order of specific serotypes 
was different. Serotypes in the 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (4, 6B, 
9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) accounted for 89.7 and 66.1% of the invasive and 
carriage isolates, respectively. The same seven serotypes comprised 87.5% 
invasive isolates and 82.8% carriage isolates with resistance to penicillin, 
erythromycin and/or cefotaxime.

Three-hundred and seventy-six strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from 
clinical specimens and nasopharyngeal swabs from children at daycare centers and 
hospitals in Beijing China, between January 1997 and March 1998, were serotyped. 
Twenty-seven different serotypes were identified. The most prevalent serotypes 
in the carriage isolates were 6A, 19F, 23F, and 15 and were found in 66.8% of 
cases. Serotype data indicate that 51.8% of carrier strains would be included in 
the 11-valent conjugate vaccine formulation, while inclusion of vaccine-related 
serotypes, increased the potential vaccine coverage to 79.4%. Serotypes 7, 6B, 
23F, 19F, 15, and 3 accounted for 62% of clinical strains, with 70% 
vaccine-related serotypes. DNA fingerprinting of 47 penicillin resistant and 71 
penicillin-susceptible/macrolide-resistant strains by BOX polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and penicillin binding 
protein (PBP)-fingerprinting identified two novel clones: one a serotype 23F 
multiresistant clone resistant to penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, 
clindamycin, and variably resistant to chloramphenicol and 
trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole; and the second a multiresistant 
penicillin-susceptible, macrolide-resistant serotype 6A clone, highly resistant 
also to tetracycline, clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. The 
macrolide resistance determinant in 89% of erythromycin-resistant strains tested 
(penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant) was the erm gene, both the erm 
and mef genes were simultaneously found in 6%, and mef alone in 3.4%. The data 
demonstrates that macrolide resistant strains in China include clonal strains 
and strains with dual mef and erm resistance determinants.
