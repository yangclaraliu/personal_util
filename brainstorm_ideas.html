<h3 id="chikungunya-spillover-risks">1. Chikungunya spillover risks</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Research question:</strong> How do mobility networks
influence the spillover risk of chikungunya from Foshan to other cities
in China？</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> For respiratory diseases, spillover
risks highly scale with mobility intensities. We are going to test the
hypothesis whether this is also true for chikungunya. Is this spillover
risk better explained by environmental and climate factors?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data needs:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Case exported from Foshan (or any other cities that may be relevant
for this type of analysis) by destination by destination, date, and age
group</li>
<li>Mobility (informed by location-based services such as Baidu)</li>
<li>Environmental and climate information (temperature, humidity)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Public health implication:</strong> Risk assessment for
disease introduction into new areas. First degree introduction
(i.e. from overseas to China) is likely to occur in provinces like
Guangdong or Zhejiang - but what next?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>While most studies of this nature is theoretical, we could do some
validation.</li>
<li>The idea of combining both mobility and ecological factors for risk
assessment is relatively new while most existing reseasrch only focuses
on one of them.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Novelty level: 8/10 - HIGHLY NOVEL</strong> <em>(AI
assessment based on lit review)</em> - Strong novelty with empirical
validation of theoretical models, novel combined mobility + ecological
framework, geographic novelty in Chinese cities context, and
methodological innovation with real-world data validation</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sporadic-case-detection-and-outbreak">2. Sporadic case detection
and outbreak</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Research question:</strong> After chikungunya
introduction has happened, what are the determinants of the occurrence
of an outbreak in cities in China (where primary introduction events
from overseas did not happen), and how will climate change affect these
patterns?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Connected by mobility –&gt; imported cases</li>
<li>Connected by mobility + population baseline + presence of ecological
drivers –&gt; imported cases that lead to follow-up outbreaks
<ul>
<li>Transmissibility (i.e. R0) may be different for this reason</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Climate change will expand suitable transmission zones and increase
outbreak frequency in previously low-risk Chinese cities</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Data needs:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>City-level chikungunya epicurves
<ul>
<li>More specifictally, we need to collect information on cities that
(a) experienced infection introduction and did not end up having an
outbreak (need to be defined how, but could be something like - no local
transmission); and (b) experienced infection introduction and did end up
having an outbreak.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Climate data (historical and projected) - temperature, humidity,
precipitation patterns</li>
<li>Climate change projections for Chinese cities (RCP scenarios)</li>
<li>Temperature thresholds for chikungunya transmission (from
literature)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Public health implication:</strong> Chikungunya-specific
surveillance strategies and early warning systems for Chinese cities
under current and future climate conditions. Do we need to put similar
efforts to cities where chikungunya introductions happened or is it okay
to focus only on some of them? Climate change adaptation strategies for
vector-borne disease surveillance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Novelty level: 7/10 - MODERATELY-HIGH NOVELTY</strong>
<em>(AI assessment based on lit review)</em> - Novel elements include
climate change integration, Chinese surveillance context,
forward-looking future climate scenarios, disease-specific focus on
chikungunya in non-endemic settings, and high policy relevance for
climate adaptation strategies</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="intervention-planning">3. Intervention planning</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Research question:</strong> What is the optimal
combination and timing of interventions to prevent chikungunya outbreaks
in Foshan and other Chinese cities?</p>
<ul>
<li>Available interventions for managing Chikungunya include: (1) vector
control (larviciding, adulticiding, source reduction) - different radius
coverage needed, (2) personal protection (repellents, bed nets), (3)
surveillance enhancement, (4) public health education, (5) travel
advisories, (6) case management, and (7) vaccination, and (8)
wolbachia.</li>
<li>Mathematical modeling will focus on quantifiable interventions: (1)
vector control, (3) surveillance enhancement, (7) vaccination, and (8)
Wolbachia, while behavioral interventions (2) personal protection, (4)
education, (5) travel advisories require other study methods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Different intervention combinations
will be optimal for different cities based on their baseline
surveillance capacity, vector control infrastructure, and population
characteristics</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data needs:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Epidemiologic data on Chikungunya by city or by outbreak profile
(i.e. categories of cities)</li>
<li>Epidemiologic parameters on Chikungunya as well as effectiveness of
intervention</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Public health implication:</strong> Evidence-based
intervention guidelines for chikungunya prevention in Chinese cities.
How should we conduct surveillance to detect secondary spread?
Surveillance systems in Guangdong, due to historical occurrences of
Dengue outbreak, is quite good. What should we do with these other
cities that do not necessarily have such history and
experiences?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Novelty level: 6/10 - MODERATE NOVELTY</strong> <em>(AI
assessment based on lit review)</em> - Geographic novelty in Chinese
cities context, disease-specific focus on chikungunya intervention
optimization, methodological clarity distinguishing quantifiable
vs. behavioral interventions, and practical relevance, but builds on
established intervention research</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="early-warning-system-for-chikungunya-introductions">4. Early
warning system for chikungunya introductions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Research question:</strong> How can we get an early
warning signal from global chikungunya activity, travel, and border
surveillance information regarding potential local outbreaks in high
risk locations like Foshan?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Travel volume from chikungunya-endemic countries + local chikungunya
activity at origin + actual detections at the borders (i.e. airports)
can predict high-risk introduction periods where high introduction
intensity is likely to lead to outbreak</li>
<li>Early detection of imported cases can trigger enhanced community
surveillance and intervention in high-risk areas like Foshan</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Data needs:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Travel data from overseas to Foshan (volume, timing, origin
countries)</li>
<li>Chikungunya activity data from origin countries</li>
<li>Early detected case information (where they came from, when
detected)</li>
<li>Environmental and climate information.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Public health implication:</strong> Early warning system
for chikungunya introductions to guide targeted surveillance and
intervention in high-risk areas like Foshan, optimizing resource
allocation and preventing outbreaks</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Novelty level: 7/10 - MODERATELY-HIGH NOVELTY</strong>
<em>(AI assessment based on lit review)</em> - Novel integration of
global surveillance data with travel patterns and border detection for
early warning, disease-specific focus on chikungunya, practical
implementation in Chinese context, and high policy relevance for
outbreak prevention</p></li>
</ul>
