# Brainstorm Ideas

## Chikungunya

### 1. Chikungunya spillover risks
- **Research question:** How do mobility networks influence the spillover risk of chikungunya from Foshan to other cities in Chinaï¼Ÿ

- **Hypothesis:** For respiratory diseases, spillover risks highly scale with mobility intensities. We are going to test the hypothesis whether this is also true for chikungunya. Is this spillover risk better explained by environmental and climate factors?

- **Data needs:** 
    1. Case exported from Foshan (or any other cities that may be relevant for this type of analysis) by destination by destination, date, and age group
    2. Mobility (informed by location-based services such as Baidu)
    3. Environmental and climate information (temperature, humidity)
- **Public health implication:** Risk assessment for disease introduction into new areas. First degree introduction (i.e. from overseas to China) is likely to occur in provinces like Guangdong or Zhejiang - but what next?
- **Strengths**
    1. While most studies of this nature is theoretical, we could do some validation.
    2. The idea of combining both mobility and ecological factors for risk assessment is relatively new while most existing reseasrch only focuses on one of them.

- **Novelty level: 8/10 - HIGHLY NOVEL** *(AI assessment based on lit review)* - Strong novelty with empirical validation of theoretical models, novel combined mobility + ecological framework, geographic novelty in Chinese cities context, and methodological innovation with real-world data validation

### 2. Sporadic case detection and outbreak
- **Research question:** After chikungunya introduction has happened, what are the determinants of the occurrence of an outbreak in cities in China (where primary introduction events from overseas did not happen), and how will climate change affect these patterns?

- **Hypothesis:** 
    - Connected by mobility --> imported cases
    - Connected by mobility + population baseline + presence of ecological drivers --> imported cases that lead to follow-up outbreaks
        - Transmissibility (i.e. R0) may be different for this reason
    - Climate change will expand suitable transmission zones and increase outbreak frequency in previously low-risk Chinese cities

- **Data needs:**
    1. City-level chikungunya epicurves
        - More specifictally, we need to collect information on cities that (a) experienced infection introduction and did not end up having an outbreak (need to be defined how, but could be something like - no local transmission); and (b) experienced infection introduction and did end up having an outbreak.
    2. Climate data (historical and projected) - temperature, humidity, precipitation patterns
    3. Climate change projections for Chinese cities (RCP scenarios)
    4. Temperature thresholds for chikungunya transmission (from literature)

- **Public health implication:** Chikungunya-specific surveillance strategies and early warning systems for Chinese cities under current and future climate conditions. Do we need to put similar efforts to cities where chikungunya introductions happened or is it okay to focus only on some of them? Climate change adaptation strategies for vector-borne disease surveillance.

- **Novelty level: 7/10 - MODERATELY-HIGH NOVELTY** *(AI assessment based on lit review)* - Novel elements include climate change integration, Chinese surveillance context, forward-looking future climate scenarios, disease-specific focus on chikungunya in non-endemic settings, and high policy relevance for climate adaptation strategies

### 3. Intervention planning
- **Research question:** What is the optimal combination and timing of interventions to prevent chikungunya outbreaks in Foshan and other Chinese cities?
    - Available interventions for managing Chikungunya include: (1) vector control (larviciding, adulticiding, source reduction) - different radius coverage needed, (2) personal protection (repellents, bed nets), (3) surveillance enhancement, (4) public health education, (5) travel advisories, (6) case management, and (7) vaccination, and (8) wolbachia. 
    - Mathematical modeling will focus on quantifiable interventions: (1) vector control, (3) surveillance enhancement, (7) vaccination, and (8) Wolbachia, while behavioral interventions (2) personal protection, (4) education, (5) travel advisories require other study methods.

- **Hypothesis:** Different intervention combinations will be optimal for different cities based on their baseline surveillance capacity, vector control infrastructure, and population characteristics

- **Data needs:**
    1. Epidemiologic data on Chikungunya by city or by outbreak profile (i.e. categories of cities)
    2. Epidemiologic parameters on Chikungunya as well as effectiveness of intervention

- **Public health implication:** Evidence-based intervention guidelines for chikungunya prevention in Chinese cities. How should we conduct surveillance to detect secondary spread? Surveillance systems in Guangdong, due to historical occurrences of Dengue outbreak, is quite good. What should we do with these other cities that do not necessarily have such history and experiences?

- **Novelty level: 6/10 - MODERATE NOVELTY** *(AI assessment based on lit review)* - Geographic novelty in Chinese cities context, disease-specific focus on chikungunya intervention optimization, methodological clarity distinguishing quantifiable vs. behavioral interventions, and practical relevance, but builds on established intervention research

### 4. Early warning system for chikungunya introductions
- **Research question:** How can we get an early warning signal from global chikungunya activity, travel, and border surveillance information regarding potential local outbreaks in high risk locations like Foshan?

- **Hypothesis:** 
    - Travel volume from chikungunya-endemic countries + local chikungunya activity at origin + actual detections at the borders (i.e. airports) can predict high-risk introduction periods where high introduction intensity is likely to lead to outbreak
    - Early detection of imported cases can trigger enhanced community surveillance and intervention in high-risk areas like Foshan

- **Data needs:**
    1. Travel data from overseas to Foshan (volume, timing, origin countries)
    2. Chikungunya activity data from origin countries
    3. Early detected case information (where they came from, when detected)
    4. Environmental and climate information.

- **Public health implication:** Early warning system for chikungunya introductions to guide targeted surveillance and intervention in high-risk areas like Foshan, optimizing resource allocation and preventing outbreaks

- **Novelty level: 7/10 - MODERATELY-HIGH NOVELTY** *(AI assessment based on lit review)* - Novel integration of global surveillance data with travel patterns and border detection for early warning, disease-specific focus on chikungunya, practical implementation in Chinese context, and high policy relevance for outbreak prevention
