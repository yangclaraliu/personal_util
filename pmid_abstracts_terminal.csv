BACKGROUND: The thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is not 
included in the national immunization program and is administered voluntarily 
with informed consent in China. In preparation for assessing the impact of pilot 
introduction in Hainan Province, we conducted a carriage study among children 
under 5 years of age from four locations in Hainan Province, China.
METHODS: From March to June 2022, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, collected from 
healthy children aged younger than 59 months who lived in the 4 different 
locations (Haikou, Wanning, Baisha and Qiongzhong) in Hainan Province, were 
tested for pneumococcus using conventional culture. Pneumococcal isolates were 
serotyped using the Quellung reaction. Risk factors associated with pneumococcal 
colonization were assessed using univariate analysis and multivariable logistic 
regression adjusting for age, daycare attendance and other factors.
RESULTS: Pneumococcus was isolated in 710 (30.4%) of the 2333 children enrolled. 
Of 737 pneumococci, 29 serotypes were identified; 60.9% were PCV13 serotypes; 
the most common vaccine serotypes were 6B (20.4%), 19F (13.0%), 6A (11.9%) and 
23F (6.1%); and the most common nonvaccine serotypes were 23A (12.9%), 34 (6.1%) 
and nontypeable (NT) pneumococci (5.6%). Children vaccinated with PCV13 had 
lower carriage (17.7% vs 32.5%; P = 0.0001) and fewer PCV13 serotypes (41.9% vs 
62.7%; P = 0.0017) compared to unimmunized children. After adjustment, NP 
carriage was higher among children attending daycare (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 
1.7-3.2), living in rural areas (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.8), living with 
siblings (aOR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0-1.6) and whose mothers had completed senior 
high/technical secondary school (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.0). In contrast, 
completion of 3-4 doses of PCV13 were associated with a lower carriage rate 
(aOR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4-0.9).
CONCLUSIONS: We established the baseline of pneumococcal carriage, serotype 
distribution and PCV13 immunization rates among healthy children under 5 years 
of age in Hainan Province, prior to the introduction of PCV13 into the national 
immunization program. The high proportion of PCV13 serotypes suggests that PCV13 
introduction will likely have a substantial impact on pneumococcal carriage in 
Hainan Province.

PURPOSE: Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) is a major cause of child death. We 
investigated the epidemiology of S. pneumoniae in a pediatric fever clinic and 
explored the genomics basis of the limited vaccine response of serotype 14 
strains worldwide.
METHODS: Febrile disease and pneumonia were diagnosed following criteria from 
the WHO at the end of 2019 at a tertiary children's hospital. Spn was isolated 
by culture from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. The density was determined by 
lytA-base qPCR. Isolates were serotyped by Quellung and underwent antimicrobial 
susceptibility testing. Whole-genome sequencing was employed for molecular 
serotyping, MLST, antibiotic gene determination, SNP calling, recombination 
prediction, and phylogenetic analysis.
RESULTS: The presence of pneumococcus in the nasopharynx (87.5%, 7/8, 
p = 0.0227) and a high carriage (100%, 7/7, p = 0.0123) were significantly 
associated with pneumonia development. Living with siblings (73.7%, 14/19, 
p = 0.0125) and non-vaccination (56.0%, 28/50, p = 0.0377) contributed 
significantly to the Spn carriage. Serotype 14 was the most prevalent strain 
(16.67%, 5/30). The genome analysis of 1497 serotype 14 strains indicated 
S14/ST876 strains were only prevalent in China, presented limited vaccine 
responses with higher recombination activities within its cps locus, and unique 
variation patterns in the genes wzg and lrp.
CONCLUSION: With the lifting of the one-child policy, it will be crucial for 
families with multiple children to get PCV vaccinations in China. Due to the 
highly variant cps locus and distinctive variation patterns in capsule shedding 
and binding proteins genes, the prevalent S14/ST876 strains have shown poor 
response to current vaccines. It is necessary to continue monitoring the 
molecular epidemiology of this vaccine escape clone.

BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important pathogen causing high 
morbidity and high mortality in children and undergoes frequent recombination 
for capsule switching to neutralize the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(PCV13). This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, and molecular 
characteristics including serotypes and antibiotic susceptibility of S. 
pneumoniae isolated from children living in Southwest China from 2017 to 2019 to 
facilitate the selection of effective vaccine formulations and appropriate 
antibiotic treatment regimens.
METHODS: This study was conducted at West China Second University Hospital 
(Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China), Zunyi Medical University Third Affiliated 
Hospital/First People's Hospital of Zunyi (Zunyi, Guizhou Province, China) and 
Chengdu Jinjiang District Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital (Chengdu, 
Sichuan Province, China). Demographic and clinical characteristics of children 
infected with S. pneumoniae were collected and analysed. Next-generation 
sequencing and sequence analysis were used to determine the serotypes, sequence 
types, antibiotic resistance and potential protein vaccine target genes of the 
pneumococcal isolates. The coverage rate provided by PCV13 was estimated by 
calculating the percentage of the specific serotypes that were specifically the 
PCV13-included serotypes. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the 
microdilution broth method.
RESULTS: The most prevalent pneumococcal serotypes were 19F (25.8%), 19A 
(14.1%), 6B (12.5%), 6A (9.4%) and 14 (7.8%). The predominant STs were ST271 
(23.3%), ST320 (15.5%) and ST90 (8.6%), dominated by the clonal complex 
Taiwan19F-14 (39.1%). The coverage rate of PCV13 was 77.3% in all the isolates, 
with relatively higher values in invasive isolates (86.4%). Over the decade, the 
rates of resistance to penicillin, amoxicillin and cefotaxime were 5.6%, 5.3% 
and 5.1%, respectively, with significantly higher values in invasive isolates 
(22.4%, 14.9% and 11.9%). Almost all the isolates were resistant to erythromycin 
(99.1%) and clindamycin (95.9%). All isolates carried virulence-related genes, 
including ply, psaA, piaA, piuA, phtE, nanA, pepO, danJ, pvaA, clpP, pcsB, stkP, 
potD, and strH. The carriage of virulence and resistance genes varied among 
serotypes and clades, with serotype 19F/ST271 showing higher resistance to 
antibiotics and being more likely to carry pilus genes and other virulence 
genes.
CONCLUSION: These data provide valuable information for the understanding of 
pneumococcal pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance and the development of 
protein-based vaccines against pneumococcal infection.

BACKGROUND: In China, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) has been 
available since 2017, but only via the private market with low uptake rate. We 
assessed the direct effectiveness of PCV13 against community acquired pneumonia 
(CAP) associated with PCV13 serotype carriage (VT-CAP).
METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of children born during 
12-Dec-2016 to 30-Nov-2018 identified in the Suzhou Centers for Disease Control 
vaccine registry database, and who had at least one inpatient or outpatient 
record at the Suzhou University Affiliated Children's hospital (SCH) 
health-information-system (HIS) database. The vaccine registry cohort was 
followed through the HIS database through 30-Jun-2019 to identify hospitalized 
VT-CAP. Pneumococci were isolated from deep upper respiratory aspirates and 
serotyped with Quellung reactions.
RESULTS: We included 139,127 children of whom 9024 (6.5%) received 1 + PCV13 
doses (95.8% received 2 + doses). Within the total cohort, we identified 548 
children hospitalized at SCH for VT-CAP, of whom 10 had received 2 + PCV13 
doses. Adjusted for demographics, receipt of other childhood vaccines, and 
underlying medical conditions, the first visit vaccine effectiveness among 
children who had received 2 + PCV13 doses was 60.9% (95% CI: 25.8% to 79.4%) for 
VT-CAP and 17.9% (95% CI: 5.5% to 28.6%) for clinical CAP. Incidence rate 
reductions per 100,000 child-years of observation for all visits were 208 (95% 
CI: 118 to 298) for VT-CAP and 720 (95% CI: 304 to 1135) for clinical CAP.
CONCLUSIONS: PCV13 was protective against hospitalized VT-CAP and clinical CAP 
with large associated incidence rate reductions among children living in Suzhou, 
China.

OBJECTIVE: To study the clustering and influencing factors of Streptococcus 
pneumoniae carriage among kindergarten children, and to provide a scientific 
basis for the prevention of pneumococcal diseases.
METHODS: The multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method was used to collect 
nasal swabs via the nasal vestibule at both sides from 1 702 kindergarten 
children in Liuzhou, China. A questionnaire survey was performed on their 
parents. The chi-square test and the random effects logistic regression analysis 
were used to analyze data.
RESULTS: The carriage rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 13.16% (224/1 702) 
among kindergarten children. The clustering analysis showed that the class-level 
random effect of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage was statistically significant 
(Z=2.07, P=0.038), with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 5.9%. The 
random effects logistic regression analysis showed that the children aged 5-7 
years had a lower risk of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage than those aged 2-< 
5 years (OR=0.55, 95%CI:0.40-0.76, P=0.001), and the children with ≥ 5 family 
members living together had a higher risk of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage 
than those with < 5 family members (OR=1.34, 95%CI:1.01-1.79, P=0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage shows a class-level clustering 
effect, and age and the number of cohabitants are important influencing factors 
for Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage in children.

Background:Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen causing death in 
children under 5 years old. This retrospective surveillance aimed to analyze 
serotype distribution, drug resistance, virulence factors, and molecular 
characteristics of pneumonia isolates from children in Shanghai, China. Methods: 
A total of 287 clinical pneumococcal isolates were collected from January to 
December in 2018 and were divided into community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 
healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) two groups according to where someone 
contracts the infection. All isolates were serotyped by multiplex sequential PCR 
and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using E-test or disk 
diffusion method. The molecular epidemiology was analyzed using multilocus 
sequence typing and seven housekeeping genes were sequenced to identified the 
sequence types (STs). In addition, we investigated the presence of virulence 
genes via PCR. Results: The most common serotypes were 19F, 6A, 19A, 23F, 14, 
and 6B, and the coverage rates of the 7-, 10- and 13-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccines were 58.9, 58.9, and 80.5%, respectively. More PCV13/non-PCV7 
serotypes and higher rate of penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae were seen 
in HAP. Molecular epidemiological typing showed a high level of diversity and 
five international antibiotic-resistant clones were found, including 
Taiwan19F-14, Spain23F-1, Spain6B-2, Taiwan23F-15 and Sweden15A-25. No 
significant difference was observed in the presence of virulence genes among the 
isolates obtained from CAP and HAP. All of the S. pneumoniae isolates carried 
lytA, ply, psaA, pavA, spxB, htrA, and clpP, and the carriage rate of nanA and 
piaA were 96.2 and 99.0%. Conversely, cps2A, cbpA, and pspA were present in 
33.8-44.3% of the isolates. Conclusions: Serotype changes and emerging 
multidrug-resistant international clones were found in current study. lytA, ply, 
psaA, pavA, spxB, htrA, and clpP may be good protein vaccine candidates. 
Long-term high-quality surveillance should be conducted to assess impact and 
effectiveness brought by vaccines, and provide a foundation for prevention 
strategies and vaccine policies.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the most common respiratory pathogen 
worldwide. Nasopharyngeal carriage with S. pneumoniae is the major source of 
lower respiratory tract infection and horizontal spread among children. 
Investigating nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae is crucial for clinicians to control 
pneumococcus disease. Here, we retrospectively analyzed clinical information of 
5,960 hospitalized children, focusing on pneumonia children less than five years 
with positive nasopharyngeal pneumococcal cultures. Nasopharyngeal aspirates 
(NPAs) were collected between June 2009 and December 2016, which were outside 
the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine(PCV) period. NPAs were subjected to common 
bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility tests, and serotypes were 
identified by both multiplex PCR and DNA sequencing. Results clearly revealed 
that clinical manifestations of the children whose NPAs were S. pneumoniae 
culture positive were serious, especially in those less than twelve months old. 
Fifteen different serotypes of nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae were detected, the 
most common ones being 19F (35.2%), 6A/B (23.8%), 19A (11.4%), 15B/C (9.3%) and 
23F (7.8%). Eight serotypes, accounting for 85.5% of the isolates, corresponded 
to the PCV13 serotypes. Approximately one-third of all S. pneumoniae strains 
were susceptible to penicillin. Overall, we consider nasopharyngeal S. 
pneumoniae culture is beneficial in assessing the situations of pneumonia 
children. Moreover, PCV13 could be useful in preventing pneumococcal disease in 
Chongqing, China.

The carriage rate and serotype distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. 
pneumoniae) in a healthy population in China remains unclear. In this study, we 
collected the oropharyngeal swabs from 513 individuals in Xinjiang, China. 
Real-time PCR targeting the lytA gene and 12 serotypes were assessed to identify 
S. pneumoniae carriage. The total carriage rate of S. pneumoniae was 70.4% 
(361/513). The most prevalent serotypes were 19B/F, 18B/C, 5, and 6A/B. The 
highest carriage rate of S. pneumoniae was noted in children aged 6-10 years 
(88.6%), which merits further attention. The co-colonization rate of two or more 
S. pneumoniae serotypes was 79.8% (264/331). This study aimed to investigate the 
baseline pneumococcal carriage rate among healthy individuals in China to 
improve our understanding of the epidemiology of S. pneumoniae.

BACKGROUND: To explore the overall prevalence and serotype distribution of 
nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae(S. pneumoniae) among healthy 
children.
METHODS: A search for pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage studies including 
children published up to July 31th, 2016 was conducted to describe carriage in 
China. The review also describes antibiotic resistance in and serotypes of S. 
pneumoniae and assesses the impact of vaccination on carriage in this region. 
Summary measures for overall prevalence, antibiotic resistance, and serotype 
distributions extracted from the analyzed data were determined with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was 
assessed using I 2 test statistics.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies were included in this review, and the majority of 
studies (64.9%) were located in the pre-introduction period of 7-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in China. The pooled prevalence of S. 
pneumoniae nasopharyngeal carriage was 21.4% (95% CI: 18.3-24.4%). Carriage was 
highest in children attending kindergartens [24.5%, (19.7-29.3%)] and decreased 
with increasing age. Before the introduction of PCV7 into China, the prevalence 
of S. pneumoniae nasopharyngeal carriage was 25.8% (20.7-30.9%), the pooled 
carriage of S. pneumoniae sharply dropped into the 14.1% (11.3-16.9%) by PCV7 
vaccination period (P < 0.001). Before the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) 
was introduced in China, the penicillin resistance rate in S. pneumoniae 
isolated from healthy children was 31.9% (21.2-42.6%); however, this rate 
sharply decreased after the introduction of PCV7 in China [21.6%, (7.4-35.9%)], 
and the difference between the rates during these two time periods was 
statistically significant (P value <0.05). Serotypes 19F, 6A and 23F were the 
most commonly isolated. Meta-analysis of data from young children showed a 
pooled rate estimate of 46.6% (38.8-54.4%) for PCV7 vaccine coverage and 66.2% 
(58.6-73.8%) for PCV13 vaccine coverage.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage among children was high 
in China. PCV7 immunization was found to be associated with reduction of 
nasopharyngeal colonization of S. pneumoniae. Conjugate vaccination coverage was 
slightly affected by the introduction of PCV7 into China because of low 
vaccination rate. The government should implement timely adjusted conjugate 
vaccination strategies based on our findings.

BACKGROUND: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is an important cause of 
invasive bacterial disease in children worldwide. The limited awareness of 
disease burden is a major barrier to the introduction of Hib vaccine into 
China's National Immunization Program. Therefore, we conducted a systematic 
review and meta-analysis to estimate carriage of Hib and burden of its related 
diseases in Chinese children.
METHODS: We systematically searched Pubmed, Web of Science, Ovid, Chinese 
National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases for studies 
published up to December 31, 2016, reporting Hib carriage and burden of Hib 
diseases among children in Mainland China. Pooled estimates were obtained using 
random-effects models.
RESULTS: We included 27 studies with 15783 children across 14 provinces. The 
pooled carriage of Hib was 5.87% (95% CI 3.42-8.33) for healthy children. The 
pooled proportion of disease due to Hib were 4.06% (95% CI 3.29-4.83) for acute 
lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) and 27.32% (95% CI 0.41-54.24) for 
bacterial meningitis. The proportion of ALRI caused by Hib was higher in 
northern China than that in the south. Significant heterogeneity was noted 
across and within regions (P<0.001). After the induction of Hib vaccine, 
meta-regression showed that carriage of Hib changed little (P=0.725), but the 
proportion of ALRI caused by Hib in children decreased (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Hib carriage persists at low levels among children in China. The 
proportion of ALRI due to Hib infection decreased with year. Incorporation of 
Hib vaccine into the National Immunization Program could reduce the burden of 
Hib disease in China.

Although mean efficacy of multivalent pneumococcus vaccines has been intensively 
studied, variance in vaccine efficacy (VE) has been overlooked. Different net 
individual protection across settings can be driven by environmental conditions, 
local serotype and clonal composition, as well as by socio-demographic and 
genetic host factors. Understanding efficacy variation has implications for 
population-level effectiveness and other eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Here I show 
that realized VE can vary across epidemiological settings, by applying a 
multi-site-one-model approach to data post-vaccination. I analyse serotype 
prevalence dynamics following PCV7, in asymptomatic carriage in children 
attending day care in Portugal, Norway, France, Greece, Hungary and Hong-Kong. 
Model fitting to each dataset provides site-specific estimates for vaccine 
efficacy against acquisition, and pneumococcal transmission parameters. 
According to this model, variable serotype replacement across sites can be 
explained through variable PCV7 efficacy, ranging from 40% in Norway to 10% in 
Hong-Kong. While the details of how this effect is achieved remain to be 
determined, here I report three factors negatively associated with the VE 
readout, including initial prevalence of serotype 19F, daily mean temperature, 
and the Gini index. The study warrants more attention on local modulators of 
vaccine performance and calls for predictive frameworks within and across 
populations.

BACKGROUND: Nasal colonization with bacterial pathogens is associated with risk 
of invasive respiratory tract infections, but the related information for 
Chinese healthy children is scarce.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with healthy children from 6 
kindergartens in the Chaoshan region, southern China during 2011-2012. Nasal 
swabs were examined for five common bacterial pathogens: Streptococcus 
pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella 
catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus.
RESULTS: Among 1,088 children enrolled, 79.6 % (866) were target-bacterial 
carriers, of which 34.4 % (298/866) were positive for ≥2 bacteria species. The 
most common pathogen in the bacterial carriers was M. catarrhalis (76.6 %), 
followed by S. pneumoniae (26.6 %), S. aureus (21.8 %), H. parainfluenzae 
(12.7 %), and H. influenzae (2.3 %). Multiple logistic regression analyses 
showed negative associations between age and the overall or multiple bacterial 
carriage, and between the father's education level and multiple bacterial 
carriage (all p < 0.05). Age was negatively associated with the carriage of M. 
catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae, and positively associated with the S. aureus 
carriage (all p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows high nasal carriage of common pathogenic bacteria 
and coexistence of multiple pathogens in healthy Chaoshan kindergarten children, 
with M. catarrhalis as the commonest colonizer. Increasing age of children and 
higher paternal education are associated with lower risk of bacterial carriage. 
Longitudinal follow-up studies would be helpful for better understanding the 
infection risk in bacterial pathogen carriers.

A recently published paper that assessed the comparative cost-effectiveness of 
the 2 pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in Malaysia and Hong Kong reported 
that the 13-valent PCV vaccine (PCV13) is a better choice compared to the 
10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate 
vaccine (PHiD-CV or PCV10) from both a payer and societal perspective as well as 
under various scenarios. However, the analysis relied on a large number of 
assumptions that were either erroneous or did not take into account the most 
recent body of evidence available. A rigorous evaluation of the underlying 
assumptions is necessary to present a fair and balanced analysis for 
decision-making.

OBJECTIVES: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has been included in Hong 
Kong's Childhood Immunization Programme since 2009. This study aimed to assess 
nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage rate, serotypes and antimicrobial 
resistance pattern in young children after the introduction of 13-valent PCV 
(PCV13).
STUDY DESIGN: A community-based, cross-sectional surveillance study was 
performed on healthy infants attending eleven Maternal and Child Health Centres 
across different parts of Hong Kong. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 
healthy children aged 2, 12 and 18months during their visit to the centers for 
immunization from June 2013 to June 2014. Pneumococcal isolates were serotyped 
and tested for antimicrobial resistance. Details of the demographics, family 
composition, vaccination history and medical history was obtained through 
interview of the guardians.
RESULTS: 1541 children were recruited. The overall carriage rate was 5.5%. 
Children aged 12 and 18months were more likely to have pneumococcal colonization 
(12months OR: 2.88; 95% CI: 1.41-5.87 and 18months OR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.05-4.57). 
Recent respiratory symptoms and presence of siblings younger than 6years were 
independently associated with pneumococcal carriage. Eighty-four pneumococcal 
isolates were serotyped. The most prevalent serogroup/types were 15 (15B/C, 
16.7%; 15A/F, 9.5%), 6C (15.5%) and 23A (13.1%). Overall, 2.4% of the isolates 
were heptavalent PCV serotypes, 10.7% were PCV13 serotypes and 89.3% were 
non-PCV13 serotypes. The proportions of penicillin, cefotaxime and erythromycin 
non-susceptible isolates were 7.3%, 13.4% and 79.3% respectively.
CONCLUSION: The rate of pneumococcal carriage was low in young children in Hong 
Kong and compared to previous local studies there appears to have been an 
overall reduction in the carriage rate after the introduction of PCV. Likely 
serotype replacement was noted with a predominance of non-vaccine serotypes in 
pneumococcal carriage with the emergence of serogroup/type 15 and 6C.

BACKGROUND: The bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and Haemophilus 
influenzae type b (Hib) are leading causes of childhood pneumonia and meningitis 
and are major contributors to worldwide mortality in children younger than 5 
years of age. Asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcus and Hib was 
determined for healthy children in Shanghai in 2009.
METHODS: Children from 5 immunization clinics were enrolled in this study. 
Specimens from the nasopharynx were collected and cultured in Columbia and 
chocolate agar to identify pneumococcal and Hib carriage. Pneumococcal specimens 
were serotyped with the Neufeld test, and antibiotic resistance for pneumococcal 
and Hib specimens used the E-test method. Significance of risk factors for 
carriage was assessed through chi-square tests.
RESULTS: Among 614 children, 16.6% had pneumococcal carriage and 8.0% Hib 
carriage. The predominant serotype of pneumococcus that was isolated was 19 F 
(52.9%); serotype coverage was 68.6% for both 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (PCV) and PCV-10, and 82.3% for PCV-13. Household residency and father's 
education were both significantly related to pneumococcal and Hib carriage. The 
majority of S. pneumoniae isolates were sensitive to most antimicrobials but 
there were high levels of resistance to azithromycin (51.0 %) and erythromycin 
(51.0%). Haemophilus influenzae isolates were sensitive to almost all 
antimicrobials tested although 12.2% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin.
CONCLUSIONS: The pneumococcal and Hib vaccines require payment, and the children 
with the highest burden of disease may not be receiving these vaccines. 
Moreover, the presence of high antibiotic susceptibility towards pneumococcus, 
and to a lesser extent towards Hib, underscores the need for preventive 
protection against these diseases. Public funding of pneumococcal and Hib 
vaccines would be one mechanism to increase uptake of these vaccines.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the molecular epidemiology of pneumococcal isolates 
in Chongqing, China.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 51 invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. 
pneumoniae) strains were from children with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) 
and 32 carriage strains from healthy children from January 2010 to December 2013 
at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. 
Multilocus sequence typing was used to identify the sequence types (STs). 
Capsular serotypes were determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Drug 
susceptibility and resistance was determined by minimum inhibitory 
concentrations.
RESULTS: In this study, 11 serotypes were identified among the 83 S. pneumoniae 
clinical isolates tested. Prevalent serotypes were 19A (20.4%), 6A/B (20.4%), 
19F (15.7%), 14 (14.5%), and 23F (10.8%). Serotype 19F was the most frequent 
carriage strain, and serotype 19A was the most frequent invasive strain. The 
ST983 was the most prevalent ST for carriage strains, and ST320 was the most 
prevalent ST for invasive strains. For gene analysis, psaA (99.5%) and piaA 
(98.6%) were present and much conserved in all pneumococci tested. The cps2A and 
pcsB genes were more frequent in invasive isolates than carriage strains. 
Antimicrobial resistance rates of invasive pneumococcal isolates to 
erythromycin, penicillin, meropenem, cefotaxime, and clindamycin were higher 
than the carriage isolates from children.
CONCLUSION: Our epidemiological evidence shows that 19A, 6A/B, 19F, 14, and 23F 
remain the most prevalent serotypes, which can be targeted by PCV13. Genotypes 
and drug resistance varied between carriage and invasive strains. The PsaA and 
PiaA may be good protein vaccine candidates.

This study assessed pneumococcal carriage in the early periods after routine use 
of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in Hong Kong. Nasopharyngeal 
swabs were obtained from 1110 children (<5 years) admitted with acute illness 
during September 2010-August 2013. Pneumococcal carriage rate was 13.5% in 
unvaccinated children, 14.1% in children who had ≥1 PCV dose and 15.3% in 
children who had ≥3 PCV doses. Nonv-PCV13 serotypes comprised 56.4% of all 
isolates. The most common serogroup/types were 15 (15A, 5.1%; 15B, 10.3%; 15C, 
9.6%; 15F, 0.6%), 19F (17.9%), 6A (7.1%) and 6C (7.1%). Carriage of serogroup 15 
was more common among vaccinated children (4.1% versus 0.6%, P = 0.033). 
Molecular typing revealed that expansion of several clones (clonal complex, 
CC63, CC199, CC1262, CC3397) was responsible for the increase in serogroup 15. 
Almost all CC63 and CC3397 isolates were nonsusceptible to both penicillin and 
erythromycin. The finding highlights the emergence of serogroup 15 following 
PCV13 use.

Serogroup 15 pneumococcal isolates from nasopharyngeal carriage of hospitalized 
children admitted to a teaching hospital in Hong Kong from April 2009 to 
September 2013 were characterized by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), 
multilocus sequence typing, and antimicrobial non-susceptibility testing. The 
overall proportion of serogroup 15 isolates in the pre-PCV7 and post-PCV13 
periods rose from 5.7% to 20.0%. The increase in trend for serotype 15B/C was 
statistically significant among children presented with pneumonia; 
bronchiolitis; upper respiratory tract infection; and febrile, non-respiratory 
diseases and for serotype 15A/F, among children with bronchiolitis and febrile, 
non-respiratory diseases. The predominant PFGE cluster of serotype 15B/C 
belonged to sequence type (ST) 199. Replacement of this more susceptible cluster 
(Ery and Tet non-susceptibilities of 32.2% and 25.4%) with the non-susceptible 
cluster, ST8859 (Ery and Tet non-susceptibilities of 91.7% and 87.5%) was noted. 
ST63 was the predominant serotype 15A cluster (Ery and Tet non-susceptibilities 
of 97.4% and 92.3%). Serogroup 15 subtypes have emerged in the post-PCV13 era, 
and these non-susceptible clusters warrant closer monitoring as candidates for 
incorporation to future pneumococcal vaccines.

Active surveillance on nasopharygeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in 
children was conducted in 5581 children under 16 years old admitted with 
respiratory illness to the pediatric wards in a Hong Kong teaching hospital 
during 2008-2010. The isolation rate of S. pneumoniae was 14.5%. The most common 
serotypes/groups from 911 isolates were 19F, 6B, 23F, 14, 6C, 6A, and 3. 
Considering only children under 2 years old, the percentage serotype belonging 
to that of the 7-, 10- and 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccines in S. 
pneumoniae were 56.0% (115/205), 57% (117/205), and 80.5% (165/205), 
respectively. The prevalence of penicillin-nonsusceptibility (MIC ≥4.0 μg/mL) 
was 9.1% and for cefotaxime (MIC ≥2.0 μg/mL) was 14.7%. A high prevalence of 
non-6B serotype, including 6A, 6C, and 6D was noted after the introduction of 
PCV7 conjugate pneumococcal vaccines in Hong Kong.

This study assessed the changes in serotype distribution and antibiotic 
resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in children before and after 
introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in Hong Kong. 
Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from 1978 and 2211 children (ages, 2 to 
6 years) attending day care centers or kindergartens in period 1 (1999-2000) and 
period 2 (2009-2010), respectively. Carriage of PCV7 serotypes decreased from 
12.8% to 8.6% (P < 0.01). The relative contribution of PCV7 serotypes 14 and 18C 
had decreased, whereas that for non-PCV7 serotypes 19A, 6A, 6C, 23A, and 15B had 
increased. In period 2, PCV7 penetration rate (at least 1 dose) for children 
aged 2, 3, 4, and 5 years was 43%, 35.7%, 26.7%, and 20.4%, respectively. In 
multivariate analysis, PCV7 use was the only independent variable associated 
with fewer PCV7 serotype carriages (odds ratio 0.5; P = 0.001). In period 2, 
high rates of dual penicillin/erythromycin nonsusceptibility were found in 
serotypes 6B (77.3%), 14 (100%), 19F (100%), 23F (78%), 19A (75%), 6A (87.8%), 
6C (59.3%), and 23A (78.9%).

In order to evaluate immunogenicity and protective efficacy of LytA from 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, we subcloned the full-length lytA-encoded autolysin 
(LytA) from 5 major pathogenic serotype isolates in China and obtained purified 
rLytA. Bioinformatics analysis showed that sequences of LytA were highly 
conserved in all strains we used in this work, and western blot analysis 
demonstrated that rLytAs from heterogeneous serotypes were cross-recognized by 
serum of mice infected with 23F strain SH137. Mice were intranasally immunized 
with purified rLytA, and serum anti-rLytA IgG, IgA and secretory IgA were 
elicited. More importantly, rLytA intranasal-immunized mice showed a 
significantly higher survival rate and lower bacterial carriage in response to 
infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The fact that mice immunized with rLytA 
from strain SH137 also had a higher survival rate after intraperitoneal 
injection of other four serotype strains of living S. pneumoniae suggested that 
it possessed cross-protection effect. Our study revealed that intranasal 
immunization with rLytA may protect mice against mucosal and systemic 
pneumococcal infection; hence, it was an attractive vaccine candidate.

The aims of this study were to estimate pneumococcal carriage rate, 
antimicrobial resistance and serogroup distribution of nasopharyngeal isolates 
of Streptococcus pneumoniae among children with acute upper respiratory 
infections (AURIs) aged 1 month to 5 years attending outpatient department of 
the Beijing Children's Hospital between 2000 and 2005. Susceptibilities to 
penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefaclor, 
erythromycin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and chloramphenicol 
were assessed using the E-test and disc diffusion. We also analyzed the 
correlation between antibiotic consumption and rates of resistance. The 
prevalence of penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci increased from 26% during 
2000-2001 and 21% during 2002-2003 to 31.5% in 2004-2005. The percentage of S. 
pneumoniae resistant to cefaclor and cefuroxime increased from about 6% during 
2000-2001 to about 23% during 2004-2005 (P<0.01). The frequency of resistance to 
erythromycin ranged from 87% to 94%. Tetracycline and co-trimoxazole resistance 
rates were greater than 80%. We conclude that resistance rates for most 
antibiotics are increasing, possibly due to misues of antibiotics in the 
hospital setting. However, chloramphenicol resistance was found to decrease, 
which correlated with the cessation of chloramphenicol administration in 1999. 
Pneumococcal strains (n=519) were analyzed by serogroup, and only 296 were found 
to be seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-related serotype isolates. 
This serotype distribution is important for surveillance of the new conjugate 
vaccine.

A study was conducted to determine the vaccine coverage of prevalent carriage 
and invasive pneumococci from children aged less than 6 years in Hong Kong. A 
total of 383 nasopharyngeal carriage isolates and 88 invasive isolates from 
diverse sources were serotyped and their antimicrobial susceptibilities 
determined. The most common carriage serotypes were the same as the invasive 
isolates (6B, 14, 19F and 23F), although the rank order of specific serotypes 
was different. Serotypes in the 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (4, 6B, 
9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) accounted for 89.7 and 66.1% of the invasive and 
carriage isolates, respectively. The same seven serotypes comprised 87.5% 
invasive isolates and 82.8% carriage isolates with resistance to penicillin, 
erythromycin and/or cefotaxime.

Three-hundred and seventy-six strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from 
clinical specimens and nasopharyngeal swabs from children at daycare centers and 
hospitals in Beijing China, between January 1997 and March 1998, were serotyped. 
Twenty-seven different serotypes were identified. The most prevalent serotypes 
in the carriage isolates were 6A, 19F, 23F, and 15 and were found in 66.8% of 
cases. Serotype data indicate that 51.8% of carrier strains would be included in 
the 11-valent conjugate vaccine formulation, while inclusion of vaccine-related 
serotypes, increased the potential vaccine coverage to 79.4%. Serotypes 7, 6B, 
23F, 19F, 15, and 3 accounted for 62% of clinical strains, with 70% 
vaccine-related serotypes. DNA fingerprinting of 47 penicillin resistant and 71 
penicillin-susceptible/macrolide-resistant strains by BOX polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and penicillin binding 
protein (PBP)-fingerprinting identified two novel clones: one a serotype 23F 
multiresistant clone resistant to penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, 
clindamycin, and variably resistant to chloramphenicol and 
trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole; and the second a multiresistant 
penicillin-susceptible, macrolide-resistant serotype 6A clone, highly resistant 
also to tetracycline, clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. The 
macrolide resistance determinant in 89% of erythromycin-resistant strains tested 
(penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant) was the erm gene, both the erm 
and mef genes were simultaneously found in 6%, and mef alone in 3.4%. The data 
demonstrates that macrolide resistant strains in China include clonal strains 
and strains with dual mef and erm resistance determinants.
